0	0	Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of "people, profits, and planet" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well. It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking? At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet. There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money. There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business. Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that. Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new
1	1	First, my background: I am not a mathematician, but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials. I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians. This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book. The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages. The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored. I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware. I recommend lay readers to check out a few pages carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it. I certainly didn't hate it but did not like it as much as I expected
0	0	Save your money and leave this book on the shelf. This guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. Moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, Peterson's &quot;Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers&quot;
3	3	This book may not be suited for beginners. It's a great addition to your arsenals if you are an advanced student majoring in Control systems or working in an industry with feedback control design emphasis. The added software is great for hands-on practical problem solving technique.
4	4	Gingerbread Baby is a twist on the traditional story of "The Gingerbread Boy." Matti and his mother follow the recipe to bake a gingerbread boy, but when Matti opens the oven too early a gingerbread baby jumps out instead. As the gingerbread boy does in the original story, the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals. However, in this version, instead of the Gingerbread Baby being eaten by a fox, Matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the Gingerbread Baby to run into. Children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the Gingerbread Baby inside his house. This book would be appropriate for children ages 5 through 8. Children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or, in this case, talking cookies! I think young children especially will be happy that in this version the Gingerbread Baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end. I recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at Christmastime. Jan Brett's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page. The authenticity of the drawings of the Swiss village and the townspeople is stunning. Each image is drawn with exquisite detail. The illustrated borders on each page, which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing, picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside Gingerbread Baby shaped cutouts. The eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole.
4	4	Sir George is a parsimonious, mean-spirited man who cares more about his cat Samson than he does his three daughters. The cat, a mean old Tom who scratches everyone except for Sir George has been missing for two days putting his master in a fouler mood than usual. Sir George wakes up quickly when he hears Samson outside and goes to find him. Someone smashes him on his head killing him. Since Sir George was the cousin of Queen Victoria, his case is very high profile so Scotland Yard assigns it to Inspector Gerald Witherspoon who has a phenomenal successor rate in solving homicides. Neither Witherspoon nor his supervisors know that his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the other servants of his house work behind the scenes to help their master solve his cases. This inquiry is harder than most as everyone has a motive for killing the baronet, including his three daughters, his ex-lover, the gardener the housekeeper, and trades people he cheated out of money. This is one historical mystery series that never gets boring or dull. The author keeps the series fresh by making each homicide case original. Lovers of late Victorian mysteries will thoroughly enjoy this tale because Inspector Witherspoon comes across as so innocent and na√Øve that readers will adore him. Emily Brightwell is an author whose mysteries are well worth reading. Harriet Klausner
0	0	What trash! What a paranoid book! A true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay. No wonder that Amazon stands ready to sell this book for $0.35! Even then, it's a quarter and a half wasted. No wonder also that warmongers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle gave it a note of thanks. It reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over American foreign policy and steer it to Israel's favor. But the Mylroie-Wolfowitz-Perle cabal DID succeed in having the U.S. attack Iraq. This only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-Israel lobby. Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, would be proud of Laurie Mylroie, since he once said: "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it."
4	4	if your interested in a healthy diet, of any type, this book is a MUST. for those already or considering vegetarianism, i have not yet found anything that compares. this book focuses on the "How to be healthy" and leaves preaching (in things one may or may not agree with) aside, so it is an awesome source for everyone. omnivores and veggie/vegans (health, AR, environmentalist or any mix) will feel comfortable reading and reaping the benefits from this book. in depth but easy to understand explanations of basic dietary needs, info from many studies, and how to make the most of this info in one's everyday eating habits. it takes time to explain the macronutrients (to include protein requirements and essential amino acid intake), individual minerals and vitamins, essential fatty acids and more. a book that i'm extremely pleased to have come across and to have in my library
4	4	I had never heard of The Borowitz Report until a couple of days ago, when a girl in my dorm showed me this book. I opened it up to a random page and saw the headline "Bush May Lack Gene For Human Speech." I started giggling as I read the piece and by the end of it I was laughing hysterically. This happened again and again as I flipped through the book until I realized I was laughing out loud on every page. No book has ever made me done that before. (As for my TV viewing habits, I am a huge fan of The Daily Show and this book is right up there with it.) The book is based on a daily e-newsletter called The Borowitz Report which I have now signed up to receive every day. If the guy can manage to write columns each day that are as funny as the ones in this book, I don't know how he does it. This book is at the very top of my list of recommendations. You won't be sorry you got it
1	1	This book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as "God", "money", "Power", "Love" etc. For each theme, the author presents a few movies relating to it. It didn't take long to realize that Higgins is a liberal Christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls. The values promoted are Christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism. Higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the Church (which I think he means Evangelical Christians) though he doesn't name names. And the reason for the criticism is that they don't uphold the 'true message' of Christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice' and liberal ethics in general. Higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'Church' for judging other's behaviors as sinful. The subtitle "Finding Spiritual Fingerprints in Culturally Significant Films" itself is somewhat disturbing. The movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality. It is overridden with everything contrary to Christianity. Saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of God (I know he doesn't actually say that, but its implied) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core. Even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly. So even though I do watch movies, I am very cautious to see much holiness in them. For as much as I didn't like the book, it did introduce me to some new movies which I have now watched and enjoyed.

3	3	Out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and affirmation for her existence, MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT is born. Melda Beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young girl she has worth, beauty and unlimited potential. For a male love that is disconnected from possession, obsession or penetration; love that only a father can give. Never knowing that magnitude of love, she harbored ill feelings for her father. Traumatized since she was a little girl, her nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a legitimate voice, and truly forgave her father. Since her atonement, Ms. Beaty has been blessed to meet and share stories with other Black women with similar histories of overwhelming father-daughter relationships. Relationships that more often than not, define how we relate to the men in our lives. MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRT speaks of the totality of our lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with our fathers. MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT does not bash fathers, however, it does present a penetrating view from every possible angle. The six powerful chapters, Loving: Daddy's Girl; Distant: Every Once in Awhile; Abandon: One Day He Was Gone; Non-Existent: Could Pass Me on the Street; Amended: Time and Forgiveness Heals All Wounds; and Deceased: Gone Too Soon, cover the gamut of emotions daughters have felt for fathers. I applaud Ms. Beaty and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing and strengthening for the family unit. I venture to say each reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings. This is a humbling read; an epiphany. Reviewed by aNN of The RAWSISTAZ¬ô Reviewers
4	4	As David Catrow tells us in his introduction, "...For me, the Constitution is a kind of how-to book, showing us ways to have happiness, safety, and comfort...", and he uses his immeasurable talents as an artist and cartoonist to teach an inspirational and unforgettable lesson that is sure to open interesting discussions at home and school. Following a glossary of what the actual words in the Preamble of the Constitution mean, (e.g. "IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION: To come together and make things better for everyone who lives in our country. INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY: To make sure we can all have a nice life and get along with one another. TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY: For kids, parents, other grown-ups, and all the people born in our country after we are."), Mr Catrow details the meaning of these important ideals, phrase by phrase, using his marvelously bold and busy cartoon illustrations. Each two page spread is a clever feast for the eyes, rich in engaging details, manic energy, and droll humor. Perfect for youngsters 8-12, We The Kids is a witty and memorable treasure, and one of the real winners of 2002 that shouldn't be missed
4	4	If you don't know much about ancient Greek history or culture, this is the best short book I know of. On every page, in every sentence, the author gets straight to the point, with no fancy obfuscations, assuming no prior knowledge. I've never seen a better organized history of ancient Greece. Besides that, I strongly approve of the map selection and the timelines. He gives just enough depth to be a solid introduction--just a little bit more than "what you're supposed to know." Some teachers I know prefer a book titled "Ancient Greece" written by a team of authors led by Sarah Pomeroy. It has just a bit more depth than this book, but it isn't nearly as well written. It seems that they wanted it to be easily comprehensible, but I'm not sure they succeeded. It does have the advantage of a little more depth, but if you're reading for pleasure, I recommend this one rather than that one. It is, though, only an introduction; that's the obvious downside of being short. You might want more information about the culture: more excerpts from the poets, the thoughts of the philosophers described in more detail, more plates (or plates in color) about the art. Actually the book is amply illustrated in black and white. But of course a book dedicated to Greek culture would have better information on any of these aspects, and that would be a book worth reading. This one serves only as an introduction. I strongly recommend reading the Norton Critical Editions of the Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod, a couple famous tragedies (in my opinion, Euripides' Medea is the one to read first), and a few of Plato's more famous dialogues. THAT is an introduction; but if that's the kind of thing you intend to do, this book will be a great place to start. On the historical/political/social matters, this book is again a great introduction, but only an introduction. If you want more detailed information, especially a look at the reasons historians believe such and such happened, I very strongly recommend John V. A. Fine's "The Ancient Greeks," one of the very best history books I've ever read. Of course it's a lot longer, but it's worth it. Once again, if you're reading for pleasure, I recommend this one first, and then Fine's book, which is a bit harder to follow. If you want to read about Greek religion, I would once again start here; but then you should read the classic, Walter Burkert's book, and follow it up with Jan Bremmer's book, both titled "Greek Religion." Of course, why not a little cheerleading for learning about ancient Greece? Since the Renaissance and even more since the Victorian era, anyone in the West who would call themselves educated has had to have basic knowledge of ancient Greece. They were certainly very influential on Western culture, and via Bactria even had some considerable influence on East Asia. I've found that Greek history somehow arouses more curiousity in students than modern European or American history. I think it's because of the nature of the ancient Greeks themselves, because they reflected on human nature via their own history, so as we study ancient Greece, we get to reflect on the nature of power, why governments take forms such as aristocracies or democracies or monarchies, why wars are won or lost, why empires rise and fall, how much blood and misery flow through history, and so on. Students don't merely have to memorize lists of events and prepared ideas, but they get to reflect about life, why the world is the way it is, for themselves. And that is what most people, young or old, are all about.
0	0	Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture". If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)

This book tells you everything you need to know about individual foods/entrees whether you buy from a grocery store or are eating out! Surprising details that help you make informed decisions about what you eat
4	4	I found &quot;Leadership presence&quot; to be very inspiring not only for leaders and managers but for every human being engaged in the business of life! As a teacher, mother and grand-mother, I am using some of the skills offered in the book with my students and family and finding them more than useful: profound. This book is not just another &quot;how to&quot; book, it comes from deeper waters of presence and compassion. Plus it is fun to read, full of great stories. A gem
0	0	The story-line is OK, even though some unlikely coincidences occur. BUT, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others). It was like slogging through quicksand to read it. The book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors. A very good editor could make this an OK book, though not nearly the quality of Susan Kay's. Don't buy it unless you are a Phantom of the Opera collector and just must have everything published
3	3	A lot of character exploration in this collection. A lot of the X-Men being the young people they are have started to couple up. There are also some breaks with Colossus and Nightcrawler having problems after Colossus has come out. The major storyling is the Phoenix. Is Jean Grey the Phoenix? I can't say without spoiling it, but it does not follow the path of the traditional Marvel Universe. Overall it was a good story, the artwork is a but uneven at times, but it works for the most part
0	0	When I read stuff on the back of this novel like, "preposterously brilliant", "a classic comic novel", and "Amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best", I immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of "masterpiece" or "this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for. The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know. All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor. P.S. If you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by "a reader"; probably the same dude

As geography and 'terroir' are key to understanding wine, I know of no other book that gives a better overview of this mysterious and elegant beverage. It's a must buy for wine lovers
1	1	Warning spoilers... In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die. Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely. Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible. I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures. Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish. While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab. I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess. Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot. Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author. What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters "learn" about them. In other words she can "feed the fire" of the story well to keep interest. But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail. Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing. This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush. Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility. This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction. You know, an assassin. This series asks people a simple question. How would you describe an assassin? Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous. Crafty certainly. After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs? Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty? So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin? No, you can't do that. An assassin is an assassin. You can't change that FACT. No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business. As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves. He never is actually put to any test. So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer. He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero. When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero. For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?). [...] Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama. But of course, the main threat, the "forged ones" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end. But I felt the whole story, the drama of the "forged ones" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did. On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting. Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid. And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all. Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown. If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again. I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff. But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series. Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure
1	1	I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific. They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident. I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD.
0	0	I think we all agree that we would like to be good and moral people and to raise children who are good and moral. I have some problems around Coles' ideas of how to achieve this. He disregards well-researched principles of infant psychology, e.g. that a parent cannot really &quot;spoil&quot; a newborn baby. Nowhere does he refer to the research of people like Bowlby, who have found an association between secure attachment between parent and infant, and psychological health of the child
4	4	Like it or not, we are all on a spiritual path, consciously or unconsciously! Our minds deem it "difficult", but in truth, we are spirits having a human experience, not humans having a spiritual experience. With this in mind, this author's book is a stellar, yet gentle, reminder to get out of our heads, and into our spiritual heritage. Much of what he writes makes me do just that: "Oh yes, I know that, thank you for reminding me yet once again!" So much of this book resounds deeply in my heart. We all need this gentle reminding, no matter what stage we think we've achieved on this journey. This book is written with light-hearted-ness that makes me smile, and pick up it up once again for pick-me-ups.Keener Jansse
1	1	The author made a huge mistake with this one. It is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all. This book is a complete waste of time. The only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out there
4	4	i've been going to grouphug.us for years now, it's the best place to go when you need a little pick me up. i have learned that people are truely psycho. that fact alone makes me feel 10x better about the things i've done. when i found out that there was a book published, i had to go buy it right away. i am so glad that i did. this is one of the funniest things i have ever read. i have passed it around to many of my friends, they all agree that it is awesome. it was the best christmas present i have ever found. no matter what people are interested in, they all adore this book. i have three copies of this; one in my bedroom, one on my coffee table, and one in my bathroom. i suggest you buy this book if you want a good laugh or if you want to learn about the bizarre behavior of you neighbors
4	4	I find Chuck Norris's story amazing because no matter what anyone else said he worked towards and achieved his goals. An interesting concept of this is how he always shows respect and a smile on his face to everyone he meets, even people who scower at him. He does this because its a proven fact that if you fight someone's negative attitude with more negativity, nothing will get solved and most likely there will be arguments or maybe even fights. This is one of the many lessons you can learn out of this book, go buy it today. I knew I could learn something out of it and I have learned a lot. I'm glad I bought this book
0	0	I like readable prose. This is more like poetry with meaning that must be disciphered or intuited. I am disappointed and am sending the book back. I bought it on the basis of the first reviewer but it didn't impress me as much. I think it would be better to write rather than read more esoteric writing about writing. I would pass on this one
4	4	I am a huge fan of Laurie Colwin's writing, so I am baffled by the reviewers who didn't enjoy this book as much as I did. To me, her writing is sophisticated yet very comfortable. I can identify most with the main character in this particular book of hers as I also married a bit later in life and am trying to have a child despite being a little long in the tooth. The longings Jane Louise has for the domestic bliss that other people in her life seem to have so easily are all too familiar. This book will not hit you over the head with a message, and it does meander ... which is just like life for most of us. And I for one sometimes enjoy a book that doesn't leave me with a headache. Reading is so much like eating - balancing what's good for you with satisfying cravings for those things that aren't - and for me, Laurie Colwin's books are like hot tea with milk and sugar on a cold afternoon. Grown up, but sweet and comforting - they always hit the spot. And I still find myself in disbelief that there will be no more books by this great writer
4	4	I love this cookbook! The recipes are very authentic and the variety is excellent. I make a recipe from this book at least once a week, and I've had the book for a year. I recently bought a copy for my mother-in-law. I've had people tell me that my food tastes better than something from an Italian restaurant. The recipes do involve a lot of cooking, since most of them use fresh herbs and vegetables. But the quality makes it worth the time! Happy cooking
4	4	This is a book that you'll read over and over. You'll dog ear the pages and turn them yellow with highlighter. There is pure gold to be mined on every page. What makes this book so valuable is the science behind persuasion that Mr. Hogan explains in easy to understand language. You walk away with a real understanding of how to persuade and why it works. In fact, I found the chapter on the impact of non-verbal communication to be worth the whole price of the book and even more. After I read this book, I was surprised it wasn't priced in the $80 range like many of the other persuasion books. This book should be considered a primer for everyone who wants to seriously persuade. Get it, read it, use it, persuade, profit.
0	0	To all who have read this malarkey, and for those who intend to, I have a suggestion. First, read all the articles by Tim Callahan of Skeptic magazine. He is an authentic scholar who specializes in debunking revisionism and bigotry. Since he like Mr. Cahill is Irish the 3-5 star reviewers will not be able to condemn him for being anti-Irish. He makes certain, unlike Cahill that he has a mountain of proof-evidence to verify his thesis. I was so impressed with his methods that it truly surprised me that some people actually fell for this book. In fact he used every point that the 1-2 star reviewers mentioned, and more. I agree with him that the entire "Hinges Of History Series" largely lacks any in depth research. The first 3 chapters of this book is devoted to rehashing what most of us learned in grade school. The next 2 chapters are clearly the authors reinterpretations of the period. The rest of the book felt padded. What does Plato have to do with the title, or premise? Where are the footnotes and sources? That makes everything dubious at best. Also, Cahill did make Archie Bunker type remarks about other groups that have no place in our society, except in a very tasteless jokebook. Read Callahan first, or in place of this rusty fiction.
4	4	This book, of many that I have read, deals most concretely and clearly with the major texts of Judaism. I consider it a must-read for all who are interested in learning more about the often obscure texts and their authors
4	4	Sam Intrator has collected a diverse sampling of stories from teachers of all types. They inspire and inform and are enjoyable to read. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who teaches, from preschool to graduate school
4	4	I am about to begin my first year teaching high school art, and this book has sparked more excitement for the career I have chosen than any other. I expect to return to it again and again when I need a pick-me-up during my upcoming "difficult first year" of teaching - it makes me feel LUCKY to be able to be in the field of education. Any teacher, novice or experienced, would find inspiration in this wonderfully easy to read and engaging book on meaningful teaching
4	4	Higly recommend to read with your toddler-absolutely wonderful illustrations! What a cute story!!!!
1	1	Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance. It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting. Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him. The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language. This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many "z's" and "v's." On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like. And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either. Besides my criticisms, there was a good story underneath, though the ending seemed a bit abrupt
4	4	Regardless of some of the negative reviews I found that this book contains some of the best advice you can get about internet marketing. Some have their opinions about his book about "how to get rich by telling other people how to get rich." Although that has some truth to it, there is so much more to it - if you think of how to apply it in your industry or niche! What some of these reviewers fail to understand is that this book gives you the strategies on how to market your particular business effectively through using the internet, NOT just "teaching people how to get rich." And the subtitle to this book accurately says it all, "making money online using e-mail" In my opinion that's what this book is about and is accurately communicated in the title. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to start an online business. Although you could get most of the material for free on the internet, it's much more convenient and saves you A LOT of time to have this book around.
0	0	This guide is written in French and is utterly useless to anyone who does not speak French
0	0	I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book. Disappointing, I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results. However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet." A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl. No longer! and it's stayed off.
4	4	This is a basic book on Ayurveda, giving a great overview on its basic principles. Anyone intersted on this subject should read it, and it is very suitable for beginners.
1	1	I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed
3	3	I acutally read the entire book unlike almost all of the people who gave this book a bad rating. Ann Coulter is a Conservative genius. She pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else. She is intelligent, and makes very good arguements. The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last chapter was a bit dull. This is some of her earlier writing, and therefore was not the best. She should have put this chapter closer to the beginning, so it wouldn't be the last thing the reader remembers. Other than the last chapter, this book is filled with great humor, while still being informative and making her arguements. She includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias (even though they say they don't)...this book should be on everyone's must read list!!
4	4	Yes, I have seen Seventh Seal many times, and it is, indeed, stark. The other night I watched the new Criterion DVD I was gifted with the lights out, the sound off and volumes one and two of Coil's 'Music to listen to in the dark' popped in the stereo. I mean, once one has once seen Seventh Seal, there is nothing to the plot. (I won't say that of the dialog because I don't speak Swedish.) It's like Oedipus Rex. This is a Swedish movie. Everyone in it looks Swedish. (Even death). Death is beyond anything from Bill and Ted, yet (without Seventh Seal) would we even have Bill and Ted? I just like to watch these Swedish people talk. Perhaps the longest scene in the movie is shot on a beach, the horizon at mid-screen, and the entire top of the screen contains a horse, stamping, moving about, never still for but a moment. It is imagery that takes your breath away. As an image it is more than I could ever hope for, incomprehensible and compelling. Add Max Van Sydow, and, well, whatever! It's not a movie that you should intend to understand. It's just beauty to watch and think about later. Maybe always
4	4	I've read this book a few times, and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories, wicked satire, and twisted plots. Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea (as other reviews have shown) but I loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting (a la Wilkie Collins or Palliser's own Quincunx) and send-ups of modern literary theory, in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader, and such luminaries as Jeffery Archer, seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist. I am not a fan of books as puzzles, but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction; it's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection
3	3	Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels. This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning. I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted. It turned out to be very well worth it. This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim. Eh? Got the hairs standing up? He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening. As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to. This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning. Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery. Loved it!
1	1	This book was a total waste of money for me. The UK English is nearly impossible to decipher at times. It is very difficult reading. This mihgt be a good book for experts but is worthless to the beginner. The author describes repair in detail, but assumes the reader knows all the technical terms being used without explaining them. The drawings are difficult to decipher. Photos would have been better. If you are a beginner looking for a good book to get started in clock repair, this isn't it
4	4	It was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the Nazis during WWII. I highly recommend this book and I hope I can one day go see the Anne Frank museum where the family lived during this time
4	4	But the simple drawing technique is also useful. Great if you want to paint or draw expressively. The pictures are inspiring
0	0	If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further. This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality. The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives. Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false. This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it. What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false. If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway. You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is. It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect. But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves
4	4	I have read nearly all of Mr. Walsch's books. The CwG series IS the world's wake up call. You must have an open mind to be able to see the true depth of this series. At one time, I used to believe as the naysayers. Then I started to wake up and truely see the illusion, for what it really is. People find that the hardest thing to accept is that what we truely believe in may not have been presented through the generations correctly. People have a hard time accepting that any belief, great or small, may not be totally correct. The closed minded will never see this. The wise and opened mined person will. I highly admire Mr. Walsch for revealing to the world, what he transscribed from his conversations with God. I truely and deeply believe what he has written. I believe because I can now see, for when before I could not. His works are far from rubbish. Most believe the Bible in it's present form must be accepted as is. I submit, where is the version of the Bible before it was ordered to be edited by Emperor Constitine in 325? Do you want the truth? Simply by learning to meditate on a daily basis, will allow everyone see that we are here to recreate ourselves anew in greatest version of the grandest vision of who we really are. ONLY IF you are truly honest with yourself and learn Meditation, you will then believe in these treasured works. I recommend "Spiritual Breakthrough" by John van Auken to learn meditation. It's the how to guide to reach the consciousness of God
0	0	Well, my wife and I tried this diet plan, and lost a little, BUT... CON: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy. CON: It makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant. CON: How do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch? Arrowroot? Pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores. File Gumbo? Makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal. CON: Somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a COMPREHENSIVE index. Facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book. PRO: SHe's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of Atkins, Sugar-busters, and Carb Addicts. PRO: She's easier on the eyes than Atkins was
4	4	This book is great and truly small batch baking. A sweet treat delight without tons of left-overs. Great for the smaller household.
0	0	Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER
1	1	I tried to find specific conditions in the book - and the procedures to follow for treating them. I couldn't even figure out the procedures to follow when reading them - the writing just isn't very clear. If there is any organization to this book, I couldn't detect it. The author is very enthusiastic about the material and gives lots of her experiences with her patients. That's nice, but judicious editing, better organization and clarity is what this book needs.
0	0	This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten. I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read.
4	4	I recently discovered Sugimoto's pictures browsing the web. This book is beautifully produced and plate after plate demands not only an aesthetic response from the viewer but also a decidedly intellectual and conceptual one (maybe that's the same thing!). It's rare to find art that is simultaneously so beautiful and so profound
4	4	Very good commentary on Revelation, from the viewpoint of everything but the Final Judgment occurred in the first century A.D
1	1	I wanted to like this one. I really did. My son loves hand clap games and board books so it seemed like a natural fit. He just seemed to hate the repetition in this one. The sounds/words/rhythm are the same page in and page out and by page 5, he was acting like he does when I try to read a book to him a second time to avoid getting up to get another. (He's seen it before and he knows it.
4	4	P.D. James, aka Phyllis Dorothy James White, has painted the mystery genre with a literary hue which has delighted fans for decades. Her writing is stylish and extremely well-crafted. Her characters are so fully developed that they seem almost like friends the reader delights in meeting again. James' heroine in this book, Cordelia Grey, lacks the long and rich legacy of Adam Dalgliesh - the author's usual sharp-witted and charming P.I., but she does pack a wallop in the two books she appears in. Mature and wise beyond her years - Cordelia is only 22 when we meet her - this heroine knows how to draw us into the murder at hand - in this case the neglected but privileged son of a powerful scientist. Brave and insightful sometimes, scared and confused often, Cordelia soldiers through this mystery from one deduced fact to the next and arrives at a somewhat unusual (for this genre) denoument. I won't tell you what that is but it causes a bemused Adam Dalgliesh to pop up at the end of the book in a half-hearted attempt to break down Cordelia's defenses. Cordelia is an appealing and well-drawn character who only appeared in two of James' novels. She later, mistakenly she says, sold Cordelia, or the rights to her existence anyway, to the BBC, which subsequently did a TV series based on the character. I picked up this book as a dog-eared paperback in a used book store because the title kept popping up in lists of "bests" for this genre - most recently in an essay by Anna Quindlan. I haven't read a mystery in years but found myself really enjoying this one - for the story, the lovable Cordelia, and for the craftsmanship of the author. Recommended
4	4	Born In Blood And Fire is a superbly presented and concise history of Latin America which covers six centuries and twenty countries, linking accounts of individuals, economics, politics and social structure in a uniform, logical progression of events which will delight both general readers and students seeking an introduction to the region's history. Chapters provide many insights on Latin issues in the process of revealing the history of different nations. Born In Blood And Fire is an invaluable introduction and survey for students of Latin American history
4	4	I am in ethereal love with Mary Shelley. Why is her literary importance and fancy not uplifted more than it is? I grimace whenever I go to a bookstore and glance each time at the Mary Shelley section to find only Frakenstein. She has other great books probably not many people know about. Such is the case in The Last Man. I thought Frankenstein was about as sad as one could allow a character to feel but after reading The Last Man Mary out does herself by really putting poor Verney in a pickle. This story really tugged at me hard and actually made me feel for the characters in a way so few books or movies ever have. If you know about Mary Shelley and have read Frankenstein or anything else by this, I feel, greatest author to have ever put word to paper, then you MUST read this beautiful accounting of "the last year of the world". It astonished me to find out that the book was out of print from 1833 to 1965. Wow! I failed to compare the story to such contemporary biological warfare or AIDS for that matter and took the story's meaning for what Shelley may have wanted to get across during her time that had neither. I believe she wants to almost persuade us of a deeper level of human condition and compassion by taking us as low as we can and then allowing us to constantly strive upward from that awful place she leaves Verney. Please, read more of Mary Shelley
3	3	American academic Ido Oren started his research by looking at the common idea that democracies do not fight each other. He shows how studies only support this idea because our concept of democracy is produced by the same historical patterns against which the claims are `tested', a history partly shaped by the USA's international rivalries. So, before World War One, Woodrow Wilson, the political scientist, described Imperial Germany as an advanced constitutional state, a model for administrative reform. Yet when he became President, Woodrow Wilson took the USA into war against Germany, and described it as an autocracy. Oren looks at American political science as an ideology: its claims to uphold the ideals of liberal democracy, as expressed, for instance, by Samuel Huntingdon, a past President of the American Political Science Association. Yet the apartheid government used Huntingdon's writings, as when he backed it against `the worse alternative' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the ANC'. He advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform, rationalising its repression, and he backed its `centralization of power'. Typically, the CIA funded some of his research. Oren studies American political science's characterisations of the USA's chief enemies last century, its concomitant characterisations of the USA, and its involvement in the wars against Imperial Germany, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. "I document a systematic pattern of change in the portrayals of these enemies before and after their conflicts with us." Also, he shows the pattern of concurrence between US wars and transformations in political science's visions of the USA. The Soviet Union was seen as all state, no society, the USA as all society, no state. He chronicles the growth of intimacy between the political science profession and the State Department, especially during the US attack on Vietnam. Oren asks whether `American political science might be more attached to America's regime than to democracy'. He concludes that it indeed works from the US state, not an objective, perspective.
1	1	he gives plenty of stats and fine details but forgets that he's talking about people. it becomes very boring and lifeless, too much emphasis on details and not enough on the players behind the numbers. i recommend &quot; baseball in 41' &quot; by robert creamer, a fine book something that &quot;more than merkle...&quot; should've had more of
3	3	This is really an artful piece of work. Eisner was a revolutionary. He paved the way for stories that were embedded in reality. He really inspired another legend, Frank Miller who produced Daredevil's best run and Sin City. These are some really gripping stories that grasped at my heart strings I felt sorry for the wife of the alley singer, I felt sorry for the rabbi who lost his daughter, etc. Well it seems I just felt sorry for these folks. If you're a comic fan, you love reality represented and you like tan and white (which Eisner said is the color people dream in) then this is the book for you
0	0	My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event!
0	0	I was truly disappointed in this text. While it may be appropriate for military use, I found it difficult to tranport the information and tactics to a civilian environment
4	4	From the first page to the very end, you love this crazy family and especially Rebecca. In this sad and dysfunctional world - to be able to read this book in two days was a wonderful and warm happening! I actually missed the family when I closed this book with tears and a smile - I love them and will keep this book to cherish with my family - always. Thank you Anne Tyler!
4	4	Karen O'Connor's new book is a gem. I found myself laughing out loud, nodding and then relaying her quips and common sense with friends and family. I've always enjoyed Ms. O'Connor's other books, but this is the best yet. It's also a book to share. Buy one for yourself and give 'em as presents &quot;just because.&quot; That's what I'm going to do
0	0	If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you. There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books. Buy any of the others. Avoid this one
4	4	We use this book in service dog dog when some puppies never out grow their aggressiveness. Cick and treat is used in every phase of the dogs learning in school so it was not surprising it was being in healing aggression. It has helped my personal pet,a cocker spaniel, as well as dogs in service dog school as well
4	4	This is a book about a boy named Matt and his adventures. Matt's father goes back to Quincy to get Matt's two sisters and his mom. Matt has to survive in the woods alone. He might even make friends with some unexpected people. I really liked The Sign of the Beaver because it had a good beginning and showed a lot of emotion within the characters. When the author wrote about one part of the book, I thought there was going to be a different ending. I was very surprised about what the ending really was. The author described the book with very interesting words that really explained what the story is about. Matt makes friends with an Indian boy named Attean. Their relationship is complicated. This book is one of the best novels I've ever read. I hope you get a chance to read it
4	4	An exceptional production. Jean Matthews' RISE OF THE NEW WOMAN provides a history of the women's movement in America between 1875-1930. This was the period which brought about fundamental changes in the lives and opportunities of American women: chapters show how women gained access to all levels of education and achievement, and how they struggled against doors still shut to their abilities
0	0	Don't get swindled by the packaging. The graphical quality of the contents are suspect as a fair amount of the illustrations I can only describe as grade school crayon scribbles. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but not enough to warrant purchase
1	1	The notion of drive states is interesting. The description of the particular states is not altogether convincing. Basic criticism: Not much development/content for a book
4	4	I love pop-up books and this one left me hungry for something sweet---Like a cookie. Wonderful pop-ups. Great premis. My Great Grand children loved this boo
0	0	I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
1	1	If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book.
1	1	Michael Seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and Seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (Wendy's founder Dave Thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) Franchising for Dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking
0	0	I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another.

4	4	I saw the group of eight in concert about a month ago and I was so disappointed to see the performance end. I REALLY enjoyed their poetry and this book just gave me another dose of it. Sometimes you need another dose to fully get into poets, because when Beau Sia came to Northern Michigan University, I didn't care for him. I didn't think he was funny. But when I saw him in Chicago, I cracked up. Poets are funny people. Sometimes they just take some getting used to and some grow on you before they can open their mouth (i.e. Lemon). I'm curious why the ninth poet wasn't on the tour, but atleast I got to read his poetry in this book, which was excellent from beginning to end. My favorite poem is &quot;Love Poem&quot; by Lemon, but the rest are all good in separate styles. All the different techniques and language are what make this group so entertaining. Keep up the great work! I was advertising for them coming to Chicago like I would get commission for it and I'm going to do the book the same way
4	4	I think I can speak for all Sox fans (and indeed all baseball fans) in saying how much I thoroughly enjoy seeing postings like the one below from "moochie" -- it just shows how fresh the pain still is, even a year after the fact!!
0	0	I agree that this book is absolutely essential to lawschool or practicing law. That's what makes even more horrible!!! I studied English all through college, and relied on the MLA handbook, which is great!! Why can't the Bluebook people hire the MLA people to come up with a legal reference book that is well-organized and not utterly confusing!! Of course, this review is worthless, b/c if you plan on going to lawschool, working as a paralegal, or doing anything legal, the bluebook is a must have, and there's no way getting around it
1	1	If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading &quot;She&quot;, you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread &quot;She&quot; instead
4	4	When reading books about Chemistry or Physics, the level of depth is usually to the electron, proton, neutron, and there is usually some mention of quarks and antimatter and dark matter, but with no explanation of where these ideas are coming from. This book gives a good, nonmathematical description of the Standard Theory (Model) of particle physics, which gives a good account of what particles are known, how forces are treated using particles called Bosons. The books will answer any questions about what is known, but without proofs. I plan to study physics as an undergrad, and probably grad too, and have always been attracted to learning about the fundamental particles. This book was very satisfying for me, and will be for other interested students. Kane provides information about not only the standard theory, but also the facilities where research is done, where the field is going, and what a future student can expect. A quick read and definitely worth the time
3	3	This book scrapes greatness in its harrowing portrayal of obsessive love. Why isn't it a masterpiece? Because it doesn't so much end as just...stops. Still, a must read
4	4	I can't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book, there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that, but other than that I'll have to read the other reviews. Anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which God goes to in order to bring us to Salvation, while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it's beauty and glory in careful suspension. I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger. Still I'll bet that when we get to heaven God will truthfully say, it hurt me far, far more than it hurt you. Amen.
4	4	Professor Swain wrote an incredible account of both black and white representatives of African-Americans (both minority and majority districts) in the US Congress. She examines the history of blacks in Congress, the definition of &quot;black interests,&quot; and the difference between black descriptive and substantive representation. The book was originally written between the 1990 general election and the 1992 Presidential election. Although this may seem to make the book out of date, Dr. Swain updated her manuscript with an addendum to the first edition. This chapter covers the Republican Sweep of the 1994 general election and discusses its consequences to black descriptive and substantive representation. 'Black Faces, Black Interests' can be highly relevent to the historically minded, as the facts of the past shape the future. In this end, the author can have the most impact by educating readers, thus possibly touching the future representatives of African-Americans
1	1	There are more than 140 popular chart pattern. I returned this book becuase whatever he mentioned is freely available on websites. I do not want to publicize any website. But do a search in Google for 'Stock Chart or Technical indicator' and you will get better explanation and tips than what is in this book. I can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy. The GOLDEN RULE... If the system works then may be start a hedge fund.. If it does not then write a book...hold seminar...
0	0	It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told. This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.

1	1	The first book of this trilogy is the best. So rich in detail. Well defined characters. Such a good pace. It made me scour every bookshop I knew looking for the second and third books. When I found them, I got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing Ms. Hearn to finish the series...or she got bored with Japan....whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot. You know when an unimaginative/bored person is telling a story? There's a lot of "and then...and then and then...". Hope you get my drift.

0	0	Dear Sean, Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon. All my best, Bill PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced
1	1	Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton
0	0	I had great hope -- sleep !!!!!! But it is just yet another book advocating abuse of the child for the ease of the parent. Yes, I want sleep. NO I will not sacfice my baby's secure attachment to me, and faith in me and the world to get it. crying it out is abuse pure and simply. Don't waest your time and money -- if you think this is how to raise a child, do yourfelf and the child a favor and giv the child to someone who will care.
1	1	I bought a copy of this book and it IS forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping, therefore, it might be worth the money. While Klein's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call, they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together. This statistical error causes a disparity, but it only "seems" that the ROI between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. But, sheesh, there is only ONE leader but SEVERAL non-leaders. Using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%. Using Steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the "non-leaders" times 2)on the non-leaders. Even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the "win percentage" is just 14 percent. Unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a NEGATIVE return-on-investment! In my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment
1	1	Reading John Simon's latest compilation of film reviews begs the question, does one have to be "right" to be a great critic or can simply writing cleverly and rigorously in defense of a basically incorrect critical assessment suffice? What I have always admired about Mr. Simon is his unflappable way of sticking to his own view irregardless of the popular/critical consensus surrounding him. Yet Stanley Kauffmann tended to give negative notices to many of the same films as Simon while writing more sympathetically, insightfully and fairly about the works, so where does that leave Simon? Out in the cold I'm afraid. Reading this latest Simon book is exasperating as he snootily dismisses one great film after another (Au Revoir Les Enfants, Saving Private Ryan, etc.) I finally came to the consensus that however good a writer he is, he is simply too far off the critical mark...too often. Simon has a famous reputation for been gratuitously nasty toward female actresses whom he doesn't care for the looks of and that continues in this collection. As another reviewer notes, this latest collection also appears to solidify his reputation for being a homophobe too. Going all the way back to his review of Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet in 1968 (where he accuses the director of being a [...] because of the nude love scenes) to his recent review of My Own Private Idaho which he quickly dismisses as a "homosexual fantasy" his reviews have had a nasty homophobic edge to them, something Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael or Roger Ebert's writings have never had. And the fact that he liked Outrageous! (about a drag queen) back in 1978 and Savage Nights (about a bisexual HIV+ Frenchman) in the 1980's doesn't absolve him in my mind for all the nasty remarks he's voiced elsewhere over the years regarding "homosexuals" (he never uses the word gay, it's always "homosexuals". Simon's writing is just as caustic and technically proficient as always (and he still loves providing untranslated foreign quotes) but all that effort is at the expense of all too often unappreciative and skewed critical views. For my money, the essential critics remain Pauline Kael, Roger Ebert, Stanley Kauffmann and David Thomson, soon to be joined by Anthony Lane of The New Yorker
0	0	This book is simply hideous, and if the rating system would let me give it zero stars I would do just that. The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as "i suggest somebody to fix that" and "saves typing later". If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent "Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try "A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of "Musical Applications of Microprocessors" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- "Digital Audio Signal Processing" and "DAFX"- in that order.
0	0	I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book. I would have saved myself $26.00. As an American who has traveled and now lives in Europe part of the year I was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers. She writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers. She had a free trip while others paid, but she ridiculed everyone. I was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former Father-in-law. Those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print. This man is the grandfather of her daughter. I am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly. Her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in, what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors, and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate. I have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about. Of the ones I have not been to unfortunately, nothing she wrote made me want to visit them. I am an avid reader of travel books and essays. I will never again read anything by Frances Mayes.

3	3	De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face. The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc. He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them. My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone. Nevertheless I recommend the book, especially for younger and middle aged women.
3	3	William O'neal covers all major stock trading areas in this book: how to find a broker, his CAN SLIM method for making money on stocks, When to sell,how to diversify, when to buy options, he shows charts of the biggest stock winners from 1953 to 1993, how to read stock price history charts and much more. It is a lot of information to take in and is not for beginners. I would advise reading "The neatest little guide to the stock market" before reading this book if you are just starting out in the land of individual stocks. Here is a summary of his CAN SLIM method to making money in the stock market, this is how to buy stocks: C= Current quarterly earnings:are they enough? A=Annual earnings increases:do they have meaningful growth? N=New products,New management,New highs:is it time to buy? S=Supply and demand:Small capitalization plus big volume demand equals price increase. L=Leader or Laggard:Only buy leaders. I=Institutional sponsorship:A little will drive up price. M=Market Direction=How to determine it and follow. The final chapter is 18 common mistakes most investors make, this is excellent advice for what not to do. This book's author believes in buying for growth with little regard to actual value or P/E ratios. He justifies this by showing all the the big misses a value investor would have had not buying hot stocks over the years because a value investor would have thought they were over valued, when they were priced at a premium due to growth factors. Great book I highly recommend
1	1	Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre. When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened. When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions. When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming. In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed. Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying. My question to Mr. Patterson is: If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first √Ø¬ø¬Ω of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end? Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)? I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters. Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel. My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense. For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows. Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing. This is ridiculous. Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find. How else do people buy drugs from them? It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames. Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal. It doesn't make sense. Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality. Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid.
1	1	Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories. Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people. But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original. The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about. None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation. We waited a long time for another Lehane. This book certainly does not showcase his talents
4	4	Here it is now, 2006, and we have moved back into the 50's in so many ways. Look at so many 20 somethings like Paris Hilton and the ways she disgraces herself without any inkling that she is doing it. Look at all the role models we see in films and TV, where women are either bitches, promiscuous, or over-siliconed airheads. Thank God Howard Stern is no longer on TV. We've come a complete 180 degrees, and women get no respect. I don't think Hilary Clinton and Condoleeza are any help. The women we see in public have no conception of how their public imcompetence, stupidity and general buying into the concept of woman as sex object for men has hurt us. Now men feel free to dispose of their wives by killing them. The number one cause of death of pregnant women is by homicide. Let a woman with a history of being abused by her boyfriend go missing, and the cops don't bother to look for her. It's OK to the authorities if young women get killed. Who cares except the grieving family? It's common in high schools for girls to be physically abused by their boyfriends, and the girls still love and protect them. Women are to be used, abused, and disposed of. Our society is run by men, for men, and it has not changed one bit in the past one hundred years. We can't even decide for ourselves anyomore if we want an abortion. Daddy government says no. All the right wing "Christians" running the country really just want to keep women in the dark ages before abortion, barefoot and pregnant and out of the work force. And women DON'T EVEN GET IT! I am currently packing to move to Scandanavia where women are respected and treated as equals. Birth control, abortions and prostitution are legal and accepted. Unlike America, in a few countries women at least own their own bodies

4	4	I purchased this book and was able to read it cover to cover in just a few days. Glenn Shepard has created a wonderful step-by-step guide that I consider a MUST READ for every small-business owner and manager or supervisor. As a national workshop leader Glenn combines his own experience as a business owner with the experiences and research from more than 100,000 managers from Forture 500 companies and small businesses alike. The author writes in a very straight forward manner -- and I like how he does not pull punches with addressing difficult employee behavior issues. Practical and informative -- I will require all my managers to read
0	0	I was looking for some christian books that will help me understand the bible better and found this one from the library. Just a glance of this book got me on the alert side. Although the title of the book bears the name of Jesus, it is largely based on the author's personal meditations than the bible. The author refers very little to the bible. And, the chapter "Rise Above Karma" annoys me as it relates "Karma" to the bible teachings. Is not "Karma" a term for Hinduism and Buddhism? What is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of God and Jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books. The bible tells us to beware of teachings like this
4	4	I loved this book. The pacing was perfect, the characters well-drawn, and the writing style engaging. Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer of the title, and protagonist, is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his Lincolns. He gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker. The author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read. This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, but based on this one, I'm going back to read his others
1	1	I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other of Anne Tyler's books. This book deals with the life of a depressed teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not recommend reading it. On the up side, it's really short so you can get through it rather quickly. I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt worse after finishing this one
1	1	Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology. This book doesn't say too much. For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book. It will be a waste of your money. For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this. If you want a good in depth coverage of Calvin's theology, buy the FULL version and enjoy
1	1	I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture. Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing. In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it
4	4	This is a marvelous guide book. We intended to visit Plymouth on our vacation this year but did not make it. However, we plan to take this book with us when we go next year. Dr. Jehle goes through all the signifcant sites at Plymouth and takes you through the history (the real history, not the revisionist, politically correct nonesense that passes for history today) of that site/monument in detail. He acknowledges the contributions of both the Pilgrims and the native peoples and highlights the strong faith of our founders as well as that of many of those in the native population. I highly recommend this, especially if you want to teach your children the history of our founding
4	4	Dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up, 16-year-old John Grady Cole heads for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen. They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer. Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be. Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere. Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it. His long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel, and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the Texas/Mexico border region to vivid life.
1	1	James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers. I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem? Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree

Not only is the book itself sloppily laid out, and quite incomplete in regard to the information provided within it, there are much better alternatives out there. Norman Dorf's "Solutions" guide is a much better preparation guide, one that I wholeheartedly recommend to anybody about to tackle the ARE Graphic Exams

0	0	I cringed while reading this book and actually flung it across a waiting area at a gate in Heathrow Airport in disgust upon finishing it. (No one was in the way and I did retrieve it - to throw it out properly in a trashcan.) Mr. Rushdie is obviously a brilliant man but he is out of his element writing about rock and roll. I felt embarrassed for him while reading this and I really did want to love it. The language is forced and pretentious; it sounds like it was written by a corporate CEO desperately trying to be cool.

3	3	The "Bird Flu Preparedness Planner" delivers what it promises in a clear, compelling, straight-forward way. Dr. Woodsen lays out the facts of this health threat with no hype and no panic. However, it is real, it is deadly, and it is heading our way. The most valuable feature of this slim, easy-to-read manual, is its simplicity and practicality for preparedness. It has checklists of supplies, medicines, and food a family would need in case of a severe epidemic or pandemic. I will try to get Tamiflu (to help with ordinary strains of influenza) and the over-the-counter remedies he recommends. I think the food list could have been a bit more comprehensive. I plan to have more than rice and potatoes on hand to feed a family of six for eight weeks. However my grocery list looks more like a summer cookout for a family reunion than an emergency stash. I suppose 8 cases of baked beans and 8 summer sausages is a little over-the-top.
4	4	If that slow, plodding Ric Burns series on PBS was the official history of New York City, &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; is the indispensible people's history: actual voices from the turn of the century (the last century) telling what it was really like to live in the immigrant Lower East Side, the Hell's Kitchen waterfront, Jazz-era Harlem, the last stretches of rural Inwood. With this and &quot;The Box,&quot; Kisseloff is hands-down the most perceptive and consistently fascinating oral historian I've read, and yes, that's counting Studs Terkel. Buy one for yourself, and one for a history-lovin' friend

4	4	This is an enormous work and very important too, and even though it is difficult to present to a &quot;modern&quot; mind David Frawley has done a great job. The work consists of understanding and interpreting the Vedas properly, which are almost 6-7 thousands years old if not more and are written in Vedic Sanskrit, which again is more complex to understand and interpret than regular Sanskrit. This is a book is very important from the point of ancient India's (true) history as well as is extremely important from the point of view of world's history as we understand today. It is a book that also provides the much-needed encouragement and foundation for anybody seeking a spiritual way of life

1	1	Love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that doesn't really have a point. It really seems to be just Sam's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup. There are some great anecdotes woven through the book (and I'm sure he has plenty that aren't shared). He goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic. At the end of the day I'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly. It dosen't go into the brewing in any depth and there's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book. If your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest
4	4	The first time I saw this movie, there was one scene which scared me; the scene where Mary's parents are dying from the plague (I think it was cholera?). The music they use for this can send chills down someone's back; I know because it did mine. Apart from that, I loved the movie. I don't know why they had to have Dickon killed, though. (Ben Weatherstaff and Mary talk at the end of the movie; we find out that Dickon was killed in the war.) I like how Colin and Mary meet at the end and how Mary held off on saying yes to Colin's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden. Something else I'm wondering: Was this movie set during World War 1 or World War 2?
1	1	When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt. But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog. Long, boring, and confusing. I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them. It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin. What a waste. What a shame.
1	1	The book is written with the purpose to be an "up-to-date [source about] DC/DC converters for students and practicing professionals". It is a shame how this target is not reached. Since from the very begin, the introduction, you will face an answer: what is its usefulness? You'll hope that, going on reading, everything will be clearer, and, from a certain point of view, this is what you get: what you've seen in introduction is eventually explained so that it could be useful even to students. However the text neither is "practical" nor gives you the "in-depth-analysis" you were hoping since its title begins with "Advanced". Schematics are rarely useful to understand the following analysis and are often badly sketched/printed. Mathematical derivations are quite good but not enough to fulfill designers needs. Apart from this it is a good effort. In my opinion readers should have to wait the next edition, if there will be a next edition
0	0	I read about this book in a catalog, I was intrigued, so I ordered a copy. The book arrived today I read through it and found it to be quite ordinary. It wasn't a smooth read. Very choppy. Not inspiring in fact it was somewhat depressing. I was very disappointed. I will return the book to the catalog company today for a refund. Save your money and look elsewhere for life changing book
0	0	Read this book! The story of a half-Chinese, half Jewish halfwise autograph man, a drunkard and drug addict who doesn't get along with life, love and religion, sadly isn't even half-interesting or - behave - intelligent. In fact it is really annoying: the initial situation offers some some basic aproaches but Zadie Smith doesn't manage to develope them thrillingly. Anytime I felt just a little bit of excitement and turned the page to read on, it just started to get really boring again.
0	0	I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more.
4	4	This is one of the most beautiful pop-up books I have ever seen. As an adult without children, I have to say I would not want them handling it, as the work is so intricate and fragile. I wouldn't give this book to a child under 12 or so. That said, this book is truly a delight and a wonder and well worth owning. I don't know how the authors do it but they're amazing! Don't hesitate to buy it...just keep it away from your two-year-old. R-r-r-i-i-i-p!!
4	4	This book is a must-have for all Lennon fans. It has summaries and origins of all his songs from 1970- .It's full of photos, too! [...
4	4	I was having alot of problems and none of the several doctors and one specialist I tried knew what to do with me. I bought several thyroid books, but this one answered all of my questions. The author is eminently qualified to write this book, and has done so in a readable and down to earth, yet detailed way. Thyroid problems can affect every aspect of your life in ways you might not imagine--you need to be well informed and this book will do it
4	4	This book is of the highest quality, from its hard cover, to its glossy pages, to the photographs and historical records. This is the most detailed account of urban warfare in Stalingrad I have ever read. The book is fast-paced, easy to follow, thoroughly researched, and extremely informative. I could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in Stalingrad than from all the other books I have read combined. If you want to learn about the horrific fighting in Stalingrad from a first-person perspective, this is the highest quality work I have encountered. I recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed. A first class historical work all the way. Impressive! (On a side note, I specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference. So, I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue.
1	1	I bought this book for ideas and best practices. I work in retail design. The quality of the printing of the book was not very good; photos didn't give much of a sense of scale, materials used. And the examples seemed very dated to me. If you are a retail design professional, you are better off heading to a local mall, taking some notes and pics yourself
1	1	If this had been the first book by Iris Johnason I had read it would have been the last. I have read many of her books. This one is at the bottom of the pile! It was to long and drawn out. I thought it would never end. Several times I almost didn't finish it but thought it would pick up at some point. I was just borin
0	0	To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988" HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!! Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises. This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times. For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around. 1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon. Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply? The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough? One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948. The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system. Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course) It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began. 2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years." Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly. Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!
1	1	It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport. I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed. If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us. Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad..
4	4	In The Society of the Muslim Brothers, Richard P. Mitchell addresses the ideology of the organization. He takes the reader from the birth of the movement that would eventually challenge the Egyptian government to it's greatest and worst moments. He writes with an amazingly objective style, neither apologizing for the members who committed crimes, nor minimalizing the excellent social welfare contributions of Hassan Al-Banna, the leader. Of particular interest in this discussion of dualities is the point made about the dual legal systems. Al-Banna felt that the Western laws "corrupted and perverted the nation's thought, mind and logic." Mitchell's point on this seems to hold vivid clarity in the idea that manmade laws and shari'a are innately incompatible. The inharmonious combination of this dual legal system "served to shatter the `unity' of the nation." Mitchell's writing really catches the essence of a group of people struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing society in flux in a rapidly changing world. His book was translated into Arabic and Arab scholars agree that his portrayal of this politically powerful religious movement is academically sound

1	1	Wittgenstein said that the purpose of a popularization is to make people think they understand something they don't understand. What seems to be a common current of science popularizations is that they "explain" things in such a simplified way that the reader who actually wants to get down to brass tacks is completely mystified. Einstein's book on relativity is a case in point, as is this book in which the candid reader is informed that "Objects at rest tend to remain at rest, therefore heavier objects will fall faster in a gravitational field." Got that? If so, maybe you can explain it to me. Listen, I know something about Physics. Back in the seventies I built a particle accelerator out of a blow drier and a box of Mike and Ikes.
4	4	I am a law student who read this edition of Blackstone's Commentaries for a jurisprudence course, and it was a great experience. Blackstone details the inner logic and principles of the common law and why it stands as an equal among Greek, Roman, and civil law. He also systematically details the logic and basis for the law of civil rights, property, civil procedure, and criminal law in England. These sections provided me with a much better understanding of the origin and rationality behind our system of law. In addition he also explains the historical origins of the common law and the political structure of England's government at the time just before our nation's independence and why it had been superior, at that time, to any other form of government in all of Europe in the securing and preservation of human liberty. I highly recommend at least volume I to law students and even to any reader interested in better understanding the origins of our government. His explanations in particular will give you a much better understanding of how English government functioned and how our government distinguished itself in substantial ways from England. Any scholar, student, or avid reader of political science, law, or history will benefit and enjoy this great literary work. Ignore the earlier critique of the font, the facsimile of the first edition really transports you back in time and the font is not that difficult to navigate. The only real difference is "f" is used in place of "s" everywhere but in the last letter of words ("greateft" "fortrefs" "fubject" etc.). Generally it's very clear when the "f" is an "s" although there are a few confusing exceptions (e.g. "wife" is "wise" as in the "wife laws of England..."). The first edition included footnotes where Blackstone cited English, Latin, and Roman works and these are reproduced here as well.
4	4	The Secret History is a record of the Mongolian Royal families, which is thought to have been written during the thirteenth century. Paul Kahn has kept the original prose format in his translation, which I feel makes this the only version to own. It begins with the creation myth of the wolf and deer from which the Mongolian people (in legend) are descended from; throught he birth of Temujin, and ending with the ascention to the throne of Ogedai Khan. I highly recommend this to those who are looking for primary sources to add to their Asian history collections
3	3	If you like to explore provocative ideas, then you will enjoy Biocosm. Gardner begins by arguing that a strong version of the Anthropic Principal is required to account for the goodness of fit between the physical parameters of our current universe, and the parameters required for the evolution of intelligent life. He builds on Lee Smolin?s hypothesis (The Life of the Cosmos) that our current universe is the product of a long evolutionary history that has favored universes that could produce baby universes (in the form of black holes) and these same parameters are also favorable for intelligent life. Gardner points out (correctly) that Smolin's hypothesis does not explain how such baby universes inherit the parameters of their mothers, and then offers a provocative solution. It is our future intelligent progeny that program the physical laws into future universes (as they have in the past). This is Gardner's Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis (SB). Gardner rejects Linde's "eternal chaotic inflation" plus a weak version of the anthropic principal (ECI&WA) but it appears to me that Gardner needs Linde's idea to produce the FIRST universe with intelligent life. After that, SB might work. However, if ECI&WA is needed to get SB off the ground, then SB is no longer useful, since ECI&WA alone can account for the apparent goodness of fit between the parameters of the physical universe and the parameters necessary for intelligent life. Despite my concerns, I believe Gardner's book is worth reading because it addresses some of the critical issues and constraints that confront any acceptable theory of cosmic origins
0	0	OK, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. Don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from Lowest Rank First and read all the 1 star reviews as well. That way you can REALLY get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. Sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - "it's great!!" or "its sucks!!" But amongst all the one star reviews I discovered some smart punters whom i SHOULD have read before buying the damn book myself. Yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews I realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. This book is TERRIBLE. It gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. And the photos - MY GOD! Its Mr Steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for "flirting" and "body language" I've ever ever seen. And in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that I find highly disturbing. Yucko. As others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, I would. Avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague.
1	1	With new findings from a scientist of the Los Alamos laboratory, the main thesis of this book-that the Turin Shroud is a medieval forgery-has been dealt a death blow. The new information clearly shows that the portion of the Shroud used for the 1988 C-14 test was, in fact, an additional weave to the Shroud threads made much later than the cloth itself, and that the winding sheet is much older than C-14 indicated. Even without this explosive new information, much of Nickell's thesis was outdated well before the year 2005. His "recreations" of the Shroud are amateurish and are not clear evidence of forgery. Most of his other information-"paint on the Shroud", no provenance before the Middle Ages-has also been debunked many times over. And his star witness, Walter McCrone, had his own reputation tarnished beyond repair when it was proven that his analysis of the Vineland Map was discredited and debunked(ironic, since both Nickell and McCrone tried to destroy and besmirch those who didn't agree with them). In short, Nickell's book is now passe, and obsolete. It gets two stars for its entertainment value, but the main arguments and ideas of this book have been thoroughly refuted,once and for all.
0	0	Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer. If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day. Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time. The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly. They always show up as just a bunch of html code. Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly? Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him. But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before. He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy. I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods. Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it. For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings. Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!!
0	0	Do you feel different from people around you? Do they resent your ingenuity? Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs? Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth? Congratulations! You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both! (I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point) I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book. In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia. Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion. Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor. I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved. Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable. What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged. The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the "aryans"- who interbred with "subhumans" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture. Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug. Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression. I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth. Also? Enough rape scenes already
1	1	This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash. Someone else knows about the money. The three major questions for the book to answer are: 1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it? I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered. Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere. 261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from. This is a legal thriller that does not thrill. The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does. Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening. I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance. Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it. If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash. He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake! I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it. Not Grisham's best, by a long shot
4	4	I waited a year for this next installment of the series and I started and finished it in under a week, now I cant wait for the next book! It hits home for my husband, he was stationed in the Bremerton area in the Navy. A good read
1	1	I bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information. I was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small. Also, the book is hard to navigate. The hard cover and hard binding don't allow for anyone to write it in it (inflexible). I gave it as a gift still, but I had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was
4	4	Just in case you had any doubts, this collection of essays (dating from 1968 to 1999) is clearly a major archive of achievement, demonstrating Stroud's preminence in American philosophy. Here is his articles in epistemology, which touch upon various topics: foundationialism, scepticism, and transcendental arguments. Stroud pays close attention to the challenges philosophical scepticism offers any theory of knowledge, and highlights just how skepticism is a serious problem in contemporary philosophy. He is also careful to argue for the &quot;invulnerability&quot; of certain thoughts and experiences
0	0	The feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, I couldn't fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with "could", "would have" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better.

0	0	I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it.
3	3	THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE, in my opinion, is one of Minette Walters' best mysteries--at least one of her best I've read so far! Her characters are well-developed, and the reader doesn't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be--NO ONE liked Mathilda, it seemed. Throughout the police investigation, readers are faced with learning of Mathilda Gillispie's abusive and haunting background of secrets, lies, and deception. Mathilda's character, though dead as the story begins, is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters. Having left all of her money to an unlikely person, her doctor Susan Blakeney, Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit Mathilda's wealth. Readers find that Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as Mathilda had. This part of the story, no doubt, leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations. Walters doesn't let on who the murderer is, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction. Overall, I enjoyed this novel moreso than THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS, but they are all very good books, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Walters to readers wanting a good mystery
1	1	A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.
1	1	I keep trying but cannot get interested in the stories by this author. They seem to drag out with her style of "he said/she said" writing with nothing exciting, except perhaps one part in this book. The story begins as the famous Lt. Bak is asked by his commander Thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named Minnakht. His guide, Senna tells Bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea. The land is hostile and murder and death come as Lt. Bak questions each man over and over. The ending was not exciting or unexpected. Lt. Bak's constant referrals to the donkeys (we know how he is sympathetic to animals, this big strong medjay!! I had to make myself sit and finish it.
3	3	This book is straightforward, breaking down each step of the heroic journey, from the hero's birth to apotheosis, using examples from various mythologies/religions to establish the classical pattern used in literature. If you just want to brush up and increase your ability to identify the pattern in literature/pop culture (ie. Aliens movies, The Matrix, Xena, Buffy, Providence...) this is a handy reference and a quick read
1	1	Ms. Woodman's photographs are no different than hundreds being turned out in art classes everyday. They do, however, present a consistent body of work that with the continued intellectual growth of their author, could have made contribution the world of photography. We have been denied this growth curve and that is sad
0	0	Nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since Socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. Deleuze and Guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. But while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound. This book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the Golden Merde de Taureau. It contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. Others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. What, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. One thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. This important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought. The book was a bestseller in France - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'A Brief History of Time', but for different reasons
3	3	This book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written. It is a book about how psychological research, motivational research was being employed at the time to sell Americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want, or weren't necessarily very good for them. Sounds very much like Reality as we now know it. This selling also extended to Politicians, and Packard foresaw the way the Image would become in many instances more important than the Message in choice of political candidates. As I said the book is filled with information. I am embarassed to say that I have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned Packard's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth. Brush after you eat, he advises, as I now recall many dentists have told me through the years. In any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that Advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture.
1	1	The two best essays in this book had been previously published (perhaps in Oprah's magazine?). Most of the rest were shallow, not long-term friendships, and one even sounded like her hook-up of the month. Don't bother
1	1	Despite attempts to keep an open mind, I grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions, exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book. The author calls Cuba - a country under a dictator which holds no elections - a &quot;democracy&quot; and extols the virtues of the revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated against those who opposed the revolution. It is a shame that a work which could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a propaganda pamphlet
4	4	I personally like all of Baba Raul Canizare's booklets on the Orishas, each booklet comes with various Patikis "Orisha Mythology and Legends" Songs, Chants, and Prayers. These booklets are a collection of the most popular Orishas as worshipped in the Orisha tradition of Lucumi. They are just booklets, and are good for the novice in the religion, or those who are curious about a certain Orisha. Worth the 4.95. Check out the whole collection.

Although the author portrayed activities that cats do, I was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children's book. I teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class
0	0	I am married to a Marine officer who is currently deployed to Iraq for the second time. As you can imagine, most of our friends are also Marine families. Additionally, my mother-in-law was a Marine wife for 35 years. This book is not representative of myself, my mother-in-law, or of ANY military spouse either of us know. Do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life. I don't want to slam Ms Smiley. She is entitled to her own life experiences. HOWEVER, they are not typical "military spouse" experiences (far from it) so I am writing this review to make sure potential readers aren't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life. It doesn't, and it won't. The spouses I know are the anti-Smiley. The spouses I know are educated, capable, strong, witty, caring, giving, women. The spouses I know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages. I shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me, or any other spouse I know. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn real, interesting things about the military. Read "Making The Corps" instead. Do not read this book if you like inspired, compelling story-lines. Regardless of the military angle, the story is weak and the writing is bad. Am I qualified to judge a good book? Maybe. I read about 25 books a year and I am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists. In the end, though, it's all about your personal taste. Read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit

1	1	I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection (&quot;Trouble is My Business&quot;) at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago. The copy I have is thick with 12 stories. I bought this copy of &quot;Trouble is my Business&quot; to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories. My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four? That's not jake, fellas
4	4	This was a great addition to the series. I love the way Anne Bishop writes I could read her books over and over. The book had a great blend of humor and suspense. I wanted more storyline on some of the characters but the book seemed to drop them. Ari was not in this book much which was too bad, I like her character. The book left an opening for another book or a spinoff. If there is no plan to write another book I will be disappointed because there are some characters I would like to follow up on

1	1	It's a good basic overview, but the errors in the code snips are just too frustrating. I bought it because it was recently published (2006). But trying to get PEAR to work (DB.php has been superseded by MDB2.php) and even the simple form were exercises in futility. If you do use it get an AMP package (google: Uniform Server) and skip the install section. You'd think O'Reilly could include and AMP stack on a CD in the book and use that 20 pages for another exercis

When this book came out, I truly thought it was a joke. WHO WOULD WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS OUTSIDE OF THE 1950s?! And WHERE IS THE "PROPER CARE... OF WIVES"?! To add 'insult', a coworker of my husband (whose wife stays at home with their 4 kids because they feel that this is THE role wives are SUPPOSED TO take on), is the one who offered to lend it to me. I thought, "this will be interesting" but can't criticize until giving it a shot, right??? Ok - there's the background - here's the review: I couldn't put the book down and read it in a just over a day. While I don't agree 100% with all that Dr. Laura says, and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting, this book has changed my life, and as a result it has changed my husband's life - both for the better. After 7 years of marriage, we are clicking like we never have before. I can't explain it to you, or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as I confessed to them over margaritas that I NOT ONLY READ the book but I LOVED the book. All I can say is that the foundation makes sense. It doesn't bash working women - Dr. Laura is one, after all. But it does point out, not so discreetly, that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else. And that the EXTREMISM of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women, men and society as a whole. And as I turned each page and as I tried to rebel against some parts (I shouldn't BURDEN him with the tales of MY day??!), peel away the layers, let down your defenses and let it make sense. (It isn't that my day is less significant, but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress. Vent to your girlfriends and they'll dish with you! Focus your time on your husband, family, relationship, etc., once you get home instead.) AND LET ME TELL YA once you leave the work day at the door, your home becomes YOUR HOME again, too. So it's win-win! REALLY!!! Dr. Laura's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters, which is a helpful, practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you don't feel like you're getting a lecture (especially if you are ready to admit you've been doing a few thngs wrong!). And as you can see the lightbulb go on with average Janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to (aha!) getting her message during their conversations, you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly, the underlying simplicity in each of her messages. OK - still skeptical? Then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot. Just TRY to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week (if you aren't sold on changing your life)... What's the worst that can happen? If it's all wrong for you, you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book. ;-) But just think - what if it WORKS?! Then you will find a new meaning in your life that you didn't know you were missing. You will have a much happier and rewarding marriage. Your husband will adore you. (Sounds rough, huh?) TRUST ME - I'm not about to become a submissive, mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship. But as I made a few MINOR tweaks in how I treat the man I chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with, I have received rewards from him 10-fold. And to think I thought I was doing it 'right' all along. ;0)
0	0	I had to use this particular book for a class I was taking. I was hoping for at least a balanced presentation, but I was very disappointed with this book. I found it to have a definite anti-life view. I found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics. Especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics. I also found that the author tried to present Catholic Church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the Church developed these views
3	3	I cannot claim to know much about Philip K. Dick as this is, thus far, the only one of his novels I have read. But based on a reading of The Game-Players of Titan, it will not be the last. The premise of the inhabitants of Earth playing the game, Bluff, for spouses and land is wonderful and the story only grows weirder and more original with each passing chapter. The only small quibble is the ending is somewhat anti-climatic after the strongly built, witty, creatively heightened build up but this book is about the journey and one could have no better guide than the author for this unique trip
1	1	I ordered this book because I really like to cook and love legumes and my pressure cooker. Perhaps I should have looked elsewhere. The recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes. However, I found that there were too many Southwestern Chili type recipes for my taste. If you like to make chili and lots of Mexican and Southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you. That is not to say that there aren't some Mediterranean and Caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the Tex-Mex and Southwestern flavors beat out the others. Also, I happen to loathe margarine and avoid it at all costs. I love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine. Not only does this cookbook call for margarine specifically, but diet margarine. In the same vein I understand that the author is an M.S., R.D. but I really don't think there is a need to use Fat-Free Dressing for everything. I also didn't like that one of the recipes called for onion soup mix. I have never purchased onion soup mix and try my best not to purchase lots of processed foods. Thus, I get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients. One more irksome tidbit was the fact that there weren't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi, adzuki, flageolet, cranberry to name a few. This cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook can offer
0	0	Frankly, Sex Magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe. Masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a Sigil. Have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal. Simple, no? And, guess what? That's all this book says, as practical information goes. The rest is conjecture, faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed
4	4	This book is beautifully written. Even in translation, I was amazed by how gorgeous Pamuk's prose is. Some sentences from this book lingered in my head for days afterward. The main character, Ka, is a poet, and the novel itself seemed very poetic to me, but not at all in a dense or difficult way. Indeed, "Snow" flows so smoothly that I would say it's a fairly easy read. I wasn't sure if I would like this book at first because I didn't think I was particularly interested in Islam and politics. I discovered that "Snow" is primarily about God, love, beauty, happiness, death, life, and loneliness. While all the action takes place in a tiny Turkish village, the themes are broad, sweeping, vast. This book will not grow dated any time soon, if ever.
4	4	Great tale of what it is like to be a modern day Texas Range
3	3	It's no secret that people who are trying to sell you something will be very careful and sometimes dishonest when it comes to the actual words and phrases they use to describe their product. In TALKING RIGHT, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg examines the use of language manipulation as it has been used in modern American politics and the effect it has had back on the language itself. Since the birth of advertising, sellers would spend many hours writing and rewriting slogans, bumper-stickers and sales pitches to make sure that each word had the desired impact on the listener. But Nunberg's research is more interested not just in how language is utilized by the political salespeople, but how certain words and phrases in the vernacular have ended up being subtly changed by constant repetition and reenforcement from politicians, pundits and spin-meisters. While the word "liberal" is obviously where the book hangs its hat, other words and phrases have also migrated to take on different meanings and connotations. For example in a political context, when someone refers to "values", they actually are only discussing a small subset of possible moral issues, regardless of their position on other subjects. Even a word as old as "Christian" is taking on a more restrictive definition. TALKING RIGHT is written in an easy-to-read style. It's breezy and almost conversational without feeling shallow. I found to it be a little repetitive at times (odd, considering the relatively small word-count), but I forgive it because of all the little facts that I hadn't know. I had, for example, recently noticed Republicans referring to their opponents as "the Democrat Party". But I hadn't realized that the deliberate shortening of "Democratic" has been a tactic going back over 70 years. The book is told mainly from a liberal point of view. This is because of Nunberg's thesis (and I think that most would agree) that the right-wing has been far more successful at branding words and phrases as belonging to their side of the national discussion. Nunberg picked up on a lot of things that seemed familiar to me. Things that I had noticed but hadn't realized that I noticed. It's a very illuminating book in that way; it crystallizes a lot of things I had only half-realized while listening to left-wing and right-wing talking heads exchanging insults on cable news
1	1	I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them. I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book. What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd? Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know
0	0	I ordered this book hoping for some scientific evidence supporting what I already knew from personal experience; that there is a gestalt emerging from all of the beings in the universe. An emergent property that some call `the spirit that moves through all things' and some call `god' and I was hoping that this book would call it Gaia. Bah! The author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world. He also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world. Furthermore, this isn't even good science. Typically I pass books on to friends or trade them at a used bookstore. The best thing about this book was how easily the pages tore out to become kindling for my fire. If I could I would give it a negative rating -- don't pollute your mind with this trash
4	4	Being gifted doesn't mean you know everything and have figured everything out. It just means you're brighter than the average bear and can leap to conclusions and see connections faster than others. You also remember better and thus cannot stand things being repeated over and over. Unfortunately, because society is designed for those who are less bright, this causes problems for the gifted. This book explores what those problems are. Both while growing up and as adults. A very enlightening book and one I recommend to those who are gifted or who are parents of gifted children/adults
0	0	i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY." guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.
4	4	This books makes the cutest models and manipulative things! If you make lapbooks, or notebooks for your units this would be the thing to get. There are things here I have seen nowhere else. It is adaptable up or down to the grade level it shows. Perfect for homeschooling. I have used some of it in a group as well
1	1	"The best way I know to resuscitate the theatre is to produce dangerous new works," says Stuart Ostrow in his very slim (154 pages, double spaced with wide margins) new memoir of his producing career. However he does not define "dangerous new works." From reading the book, it seems his definition of "dangerous new works" is whatever is being touted by the Village Voice. (Richard Foreman, homosexuality, multiculturalism, Tom Eyen, etc.) Stuart Ostrow has a story, but he is looking at it from the wrong point of view. The way he sees it, he was producing quality innovative stuff that the world conspired to make fail. Another way of looking at it would show a talented young producer who, after producing big hits with 1776 and PIPPIN, went pretentious and politically correct with his subsequent shows and understandably failed. His damnation of Mel Brooks is unjustified since Ostrow himself says that he has not seen THE PRODUCERS. Well, Stu, I have news for you. THE PRODUCERS was a dangerous new work. It was a slap in the face at political correctness and pretentiousness. It single-handedly killed the bloated Euro Musical that had dominated Broadway for twenty years and paved the way for outrageous, unpretentious shows like HAIRSPRAY and THE WEDDING SINGER. THE PRODUCERS resuscitated the American musical and Ostrow missed it. Ostrow also badmouths WICKED claiming it was dependent upon special effects and spectacle. If that were true, DANCE OF THE VAMPIRES would still be running. The spectacle of WICKED enhances its compelling story, unlike the all the additional sets and extra players gratuitously inserted into the boring LA BETE. Ostrow seems to think that problems can be solved by creating yet another bureaucracy to choose the artists who shall be anointed. Evidence has show that the bureaucratic method produces pretentious work like that of Michael John LaChiusa and Jason Robert Brown, which the public doggedly refuses to embrace. Ostrow tells some good anecdotes, but I wish there had been more of them. There's the germ of a fascinating book in this volume and in Ostrow's previous memoir (also extremely brief and shares some material with this volume). But at this point, there's still not a real book between the two of them
4	4	Excellent presentation of the material in an easy to follow format. Allows the reader to pinpoint exact areas of interest, and contains only information pertainent to the title. A must have for writing resumes with confidence and skill
0	0	The main character of Hospital Sketches is Nurse Tribulation Periwinkle. The book is about her experiences as a nurse at a Washington D.C. hospital during the civil war. The theme is cheerful despite the wounded men. One man showed his gratitude for the way she helped him stay cheerful by offering "I've got a pair of earbobs and a handkerchief pin I'm a-goin' to give you"(Alcott 69). Cheerfulness is shown when a nurse says, "Bless their hearts..."(Alcott 75) because she is so proud of the soldiers. The Author makes everything more confusing than it has to be. For instance, "as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances that lighted us to bed"(Alcott 75). She uses this sentence to say that people smiled at the nurses as they went to bed. She often switches from one subject to another without making any indication of it, leaving you confused. "At the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals prevailed"(Alcott 77). She says this while she is telling you about the breakfast she is eating. That has nothing to do with breakfast. She is unclear about what she is referring to. The main Conflict doesn't come until the end. She gets sick and needs to decide whether to keep on working there, or go home and try to get better. She decides to go home because her father says, "Come home." I think this book was poorly written, and I don't recommend it to anyone
4	4	Avorn's beautifully written book seems to become more important for "the rest of us" with every breaking news story about the pharmecutical industry. My suggestion in the light of the Vioxx disaster? If you are interested in your own health and the medicines we take so casually, then buy a copy of this beautifully written and oh so revealing book. Let me give you a flavor of just how good a writer Avorn he and how revealing this book is by quoting the way he introduces a chapter from this book: "In a former British colony, most healers believed the conventional wisdom that a distillation of fluids extracted from the urine of horses, if dried to a powder and fed to aging women, could act as a general tonic, preserve youth, and ward off a variety of diseases. The preparation became enormously popular throughout the culture, and was used widely by older women in all strata of society. Many years later modern scientific studies revealed that long-term ingestion of the horse-urine extract was useless for most of its intended purposes, and that it caused tumors, blood clots, heart disease, and perhaps brain damage." This (sad) "fairy tale" introduces the whole sorry tale of hormone replacement therapy for women, and how badly the research was to defend it. The book just gets better from here
4	4	This is the first volume of Churchill's Noble Prize winning six part chronicle of World War II. The Gathering Storm depicts the rise of Hitler and the indifference of the leaders of the European democracies to the clouds of the gathering storm. Churchill incorporates contemporary documentation and his own reminiscence in this opening memoir. Churchill was a great statesman with great literary ability - a winning combination. The Gathering Storm a unique work and has a message for us in today's world. Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Keple
4	4	perhaps this is the most romantic and most beautiful book of love poems ever written. every word, every stanza is so easily read, so quickly understood, like an arrow to the heard. give this gift to your lover and they will never forget it
1	1	Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book. The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance. There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity. The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores. Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket. Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs. Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness. The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else. The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent. Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style. It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced. I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype.
0	0	I bought this hoping to add to my collection of Judy Reeves's prompts, unfortunately all this is is a repackaging of A Writer's Book of Days: A Spirited Companion and Lively Muse for the Writing Life. The year's worth of prompts are in the kit's book, followed by lined pages. The advice and encouragement on the kit's cards can be found among the pages of her Writing Book of Days. I'm very disappointed that Reeves couldn't create more prompts rather than simply making more money off of her previous work
4	4	We got this book last year at Christmas, and it has some great ideas for &quot;spontaneous' games that you can play with the kids while traveling. Whether you are going by car, plane or train, the kids frequently get antsy or bored. There are many games that take no planning, and use common things around you, to entertain, get silly, and just enjoy
0	0	I'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far. Unless you're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you're going to find yourself lost and disinterested. The first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what I thought would be a good story. The remaining chapters had little connection to this however. The book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk, little character development, tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters. Even Clancy's much maligned Red Rabbit is far superior to this
0	0	Getting ready to go on international assignment, I picked up a copy of this book. The author's breathless inanities ran along the lines of (a paraphrase), &quot;wow, some British men used to wear bowler hats.&quot; I found very little useful in this book to prepare me for the transition, and was occasionally offended by his borderlne racist generalizations. I was expecting sociology and got sleaze instead
3	3	I myself write westerns, so I bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate. While the information contained in this book isn't quite as specific as I would have liked, it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts, such as slang terms cowboys used, the terms used for the different hairstyles during the 19th century, and common diseases that plagued the population. It also lists the different types of horses, which is a tremendous help for me. If you write novels or are just an avid history buff (of which I am both), then I think you will find this book interesting
0	0	The biggest disappointment of this book is that the comments about the CIA - training and operation - are akin to what might have been written at the end of the day into a diary. There was passage after passage that begged for insight that her (limited) experience brought, but I don't remember a single case of finding this. The criticism of the CIA training is rendered in terms of the students' shortcomings in the exercises, with no thought to why they didn't do better, or if their performance - while not good - was in fact passable. I suspect that the people from the intelligence agencies that gave high marks to this book are doing so because they find the public criticisms of the CIA refreshing and useful/needed, and that they could fill in the insights on their own. Despite having read multiple of the reviews here, I was still unprepared for the sheer amount of time talking about her personal life (one reviewer overstates it as being 75%) and how trite it was. The reviews here had prepared me for the arrogance of a 30-something, but what I encountered was more the self-absorption of a teenager. The librarian who shelfed this book in the teen section may have been making a different editorial comment than the reviewer (2006-Aug-15) who reported it (reviewer gave it 5 stars for the teen reader). The book has many hints and clues that the author is substantial and interesting, and this may keep you reading. However, that person never emerges
3	3	This work grabs you immediately with its description of the "standstill" procedure. A patient is placed into a coma, the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter. Fascinating stuff. The author is a journalist obviously awed by Dr. Spetzler and all that he (and others) have accomplished at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix--the book is primarily a story of Dr. Spetzler's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery. The reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents--rounds, M&M conferences, surgical procedures, etc. There are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible. But something was missing. In attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery (as well as a curious diversion into the history of Phoenix) this book lost some of its punch. This could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of Dr. Spetzler (and if anyone writes one--I'm buying it), or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases . Better yet, a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines. Not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed--and not for the better. Unfortunately, the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus. Nevertheless, highly recommended
1	1	This book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class. In my opinion, the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together. Totally different writing style as you go throught the book. In addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw. n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent. Our professor ended up hating the book himself. A good reference maybe but not for the beginner
3	3	an analysis of this sort was sorely needed. this book is factual in addition to being cute. i would highly recommend it to anyone
4	4	I'd like to know where I can get one of these famous-cities skirts...especially if they draw in handsome young Southern studs like Logan Bruno
3	3	This is oe of my favorite suspense authors. I wish she would write faster. I really have enjoyed all of her books. They are well written and interesting, exciting stories. Definitely recommended
0	0	Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this "vintage" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear
4	4	Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying "Truth is stranger than fiction" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments
3	3	Another entertaining book in the series. Good fun with some real life problems. Book eight is enjoyable too
3	3	Poirot is given a case by his old pal Spence which takes him to a small village, where the fussy detective must unravel clues behind a crime in which the main suspect has already been arrested and sentenced... Hercule's indignities at the run down boarding house he's staying at make up the bulk of the story's humor, but the mystery is great fun, too and I doubt anyone can guess the killer, unless you're paying amazingly close attention. The characters here are some of Agatha's most entertaining, and Mrs Oliver, with her uncanny intuition, always makes a nice flighty side kick..
3	3	Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle
1	1	sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined
0	0	This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective. The research is suspect. The prose amateurish. The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work
0	0	this book stinks on ice. No offense of corse. This is not one of NB's best books. I read ten pages and then i knew the ending. A boy goes on top of a volcano to find a monster. it turns out the monster is, well i won't give the ending away. Stick to your Harry Potters and Artimis Fowl. I really advise you not to by this book. Please don't. I am not sure if you will but if you do buy it, it will be in the garbage can in two days or les

0	0	What so many past and even some current chelas overlook is that there is a difference between Sri Harold Klemp, the man, and the ECK which uses and continues to use him as ITS divine channel in all the worlds of God. Recently I took the fourth initiation in ECKANKAR. Yesterday, while in contemplation I sang my new secret word with my attention on the current Living ECK Master and experienced the Light of God. Ford Johnson's assertion that chelas are prevented from becoming Masters is a falsehood. Before Millie Moore translated she had reached the Ninth Initiation, the point at which ECK Mastership commences. It's sad to see a former High Initiate like Ford Johnson who has become 'twisted by the Dark Side'
0	0	Why do I feel like the serpent in the Garden of Eden?... Sorry, I really liked "Deep Waters", but I probably won't buy another JAK unless I am stuck at an airport and I have read every other available Romance, Mystery or Thriller on the newsstand. I think I have made myself clear. It is time for me to find some new talented authors. Although I know I have some previously read titles of hers to review. Hopefully, they are better than this
4	4	I first read Martin's Hundred when I was in the hospital waiting to give birth to my first child. I managed to stay interested between my labor pains, and that says a lot about Mr. Hulme's writing! I've re-read it four times since. The archaeological details and interpretations are utterly fascinating, especially those of the pointed-roof coffins and poor &quot;Granny's hairdo.&quot; The colonists who inhabited the Carter's Grove site really came alive for me. This is an all- time favorite book of mine
3	3	a very well-considered look at the realtionship between digital communications technology and local communities, with particularly good treatment of public access, education, and attempts to use computers to enhance, rather than undermine, neighborhood and community relations. Highly recommended
3	3	The book moves, is enlightening, funny, and educational. If you have ever walked in the woods, it might not look the same again
1	1	Morris believes that the Bible can be scientifically proven. This is impossible, since the Bible is a religious text. It is an interesting read, but keep in mind that Morris uses bad science and fallacy after fallacy to make his religion look scientific
0	0	I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad. It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were. Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin. The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books. I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book. I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo
4	4	As a Texan who first moved to Europe at age 13 in 1961, Pell's book was like reading the story of my life. And yet it made me understand so many things that were always something of a conundrum (such as why the French looked down on everything American in general but adored the Kennedy's) to the sinister goings-on of the McCarthy era (they actually burned books considered subversive in American embassies abroad, such as "works by notorious radicals like Mark Twain and Theodore Dreiser"). I got this book because I wanted to have a better understanding of why the U.S. is where it is today, and it more than filled the bill, in an all-emcompassing way. Thank you, Mr. Pells
3	3	This book is an excellent resource for Church Education staff. This book covers some basic principles (or laws as he calls them) regarding teaching in the church environment. The law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch, as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment. This is so true and often followed in higher education, but perhaps not very well followed in church education. The sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning. But according to Henricks a student must study, must come to class on time, and must be interested in the material to proactively learn. There is much more good stuff in this book. Grab it its a great read

4	4	A wonderful portrait of the dashing, romantic Columbo. Virtually forgotten for the last half-century, Columbo was as popular as Bing Crosby in the early 1930s and considered a heart-throb on a par with actor Rudolph Valentino. But at age 26, he was shot and killed by his best friend in a freak accident, ending one of the most promising careers in music and film. Columbo was the archetypal 1930s "crooner," who gave "an impression of emotional restraint, of power in reserve." Despite the co-author credit, the book was in fact written by Lanza, a master wordsmith (and author of Elevator Music, The Cocktail, and Gravity). Penna supplied the copious archival photographs, letters and news clippings that beautifully augment the text. Lanza, who calls Columbo "an enigma wrapped inside a press release," treats his subject with respect, yet with a proper historical detachment that avoids hagiography. Columbo was as talented and charismatic as he was troubled, flawed, ambivalent, and stubborn, and Lanza makes no excuses for him. At the same time, the chronology is authoritative, and there's abundant humor, even when considering Columbo's inner torment (referring to Columbo's pet name for his adored Carole Lombard, Lanza refers to the singer's despair at not getting enough "quality Pookie time"). Lanza describing Columbo emerging from a swimming pool: "...a sight no less mythical than Venus rising from her half-shell. His dark eyes sparkled as the refracted sunlight grafted a halo around his wet hair, the water pouring like pearls of amniotic effluvia from a chlorinated incubator." Such vivid images tantalize on every page, but the book never bogs down in literary preciousness; it represents solid, well-researched journalism. Columbo's love letters to Lombard are revealing in their pathetic desperation, demonstrating that the adoration of a million wistful female fans cannot allay unrequited passion. An excellent read, and the cast of characters are richly drawn
0	0	How anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long life goes beyond my comprehension. This is what Estes claims in this book. What about those who live short lives? The whole book is geared at American middle-class readers who in general, even though they have college-education, are very naive. The language is that of the fairy-tale, or close to it, which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people. Estes says that pain will clarify everything. I pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified
4	4	I'm usually dismissive of most Die Zauberflotes because I find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking. Then I came upon this recording...I have to say that it is simply the most amazing Die Zauberflote I've ever heard! The orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself...everything is mind-blowing! I'm not a Mozart person, but if I really like a recording of his I will buy it. This is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the Flute, especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera. And the Queen of the Night-Edda Moser!!! Amazing! Simply amazing! No other Queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing. This is the Flute. I would suggest Marriner's version if I hadn't seen this one, but then here is a Flute with all the greats in it! Get it now
0	0	Because she is a real-life "Wife Of," Gigi Levangie Grazer has been hailed as the "on the inside" Hollywood chick-litter. Inexplicably, it turns out, because "The Starter Wife" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from Nebraska could dream up. Gracie is a "Wife Of" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a Hollywood heavyweight with one kid. Until Kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells Gracie that he wants a divorce. In the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, Gracie finds out that he's having an affair with Britney Spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with Kevin Whatsisface). A concerned pal lends Gracie her Malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. And as she wanders the California beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, Gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and Kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. Can she become more than Kenny's "starter wife"? Okay, it has a different plot -- one that Shar Jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. But the core of "The Starter Wife" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. It's even worse that much of Grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, Brad and Jen have broken up. So no one's worried about them procreating. Grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between Hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. The writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. Grazer even has the excruciating taste to name Gracie's gay pal "Will." It's not witty or cute, just embarrassing. Perhaps the biggest flaw is that Gracie -- the wronged Wife Of-turned-Starter Wife -- is a pill. Despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. Kenny is a cliche of the Selfish Ex, while Will is a cliche of the Lovable Gay Pal. Only Lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person. With more Hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, Gigi Levangie Grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. Sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really BAD fluff
3	3	Although the book is great, it speaks for itself and I'm not here to review it. I emailed the author, or someone who works with her, at the email address I got from Jan's website. First of all, a little background. I have a two-year-old border collie/lab who I've had since he was seven weeks. I adore him. I have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago. I now work 5 days a week outside the house. I wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog, and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while I'm at work. My response was that I am &quot;selfish&quot; and unfit to have a dog. This coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep. I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested. But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him. Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally. She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners. It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them. Rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change, she chose instead to say, Sorry! Not interested! Not at all what I had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion

0	0	I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.). Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans. Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol: COSTS Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure? First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...) Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.) ACHIEVEMENT In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids... In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools. When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student. Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races. VESTED INTERESTS It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades. Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections. Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact! Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers. HYPOCRISY A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race. Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...) I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.) I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?) What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol... (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)

3	3	Beatrice "Bede" Dunn became fascinated with wild orchids when she got a summer job with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. They sent her to the Bruce Peninsula to map orchids. She spent three months there, wandering around the woodlands, doing some serious hiking and camping-out. When she returned in the fall with fifty rolls of film, she had a new avocation - wild orchid hunting. Bede became passionate about "documenting the existence of a single flower or the breeding ground of a particular species." In 1984 she and her boyfriend, Scott, went on a hiking holiday in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. When it began to rain, the couple had an argument about whether to leave their camp and seek shelter elsewhere or to stay put. Bede was adamant about remaining and so she did - alone. When Scott returned two days later the tent and their things were still at the campsite, but Bede was gone, along with her camera, backpack, Michelin guide and a book on wildflowers and orchids. No one ever saw the young woman again. After a massive search and investigation, which garnered much publicity, no evidence of foul play was discovered, no body, no crime scene. Mara Dunn, Bede's identical twin, has never resigned herself to the loss of her sister. She moved to the Dordogne after her divorce became final and went into the interior design business, all the while maintaining contact with the police. Nothing concrete, however, was found concerning the disappearance. During an antique hunting expedition in a near-by town, Mara discovered an old Canon camera in a pile of junk. She noticed it immediately, even though the case was mildewed and worn, because it was identical to the cameras her parents had given her and her sister for their high school graduation. She was sure it was the camera her sister had traveled to France with. Inside the case the initials "B. D." were written, and inside the camera was an undeveloped roll of film. Damaged by time and dampness, but still viable, thirty-four photographs were revealed upon development, of wild orchids and a dovecote, taken in what appears to be the local landscape. Mara is convinced the photographs document her sibling's final days. Now, almost twenty years after Bede vanished, Mara, with the photographs in hand, makes yet another effort to find her sister, or her remains. Julian Wood is an English expatriate living in Dordogne and an expert on wild orchids. He is also the author of "Wildflowers of the Dordogne/ Fleurs sauvages de la Dordogne," and the man Mara wants to assist her. She asks him to help her retrace her sister's footsteps using the photographs as a guide. Julian is skeptical about turning up anything new on the missing woman. He doesn't really want to get involved and he doesn't care much for pushy, intense women. Besides, the police have copies of the photographs and don't seem very excited by them. When Julian views the final picture though, he becomes agitated and as motivated to begin a search as Mara, but for different reasons. The photo is of a Cypripedium - Sabot de Venus in French, sometimes called Lady's Slipper in English. And since this rare wild orchid does not grow in the Dordogne, or anywhere in Europe, he has his own mystery to unravel - if he decides to become involved with Mara and her investigation. Not only is "Deadly Slipper" a good literary mystery, it is really a fun book to read. Filled with an exotic cast of characters - from the local bogeyman and his mother, who is even scarier than her son, to the bizarre Sauvignac family, (the local nobility), to Julian Wood's fanatic orchid hunting nemesis and competitor, and the regulars down at Chez Nous, the town's cafe/bar/gourmet restaurant, plus a French police inspector and his lads, these personages all enrich the narrative. The horticulture tidbits are fascinating, and I'm no gardener. The description of food, wine, the gorgeous countryside - c'est tres magnifique! The setting IS France! There is even some romancing going on in between gruesome discoveries. You cannot go wrong, especially if you're looking for something different in sleuthing. JAN
1	1	I purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children. I liked the story but the chapters were way too long. My children kept asking, "how many more pages?"
4	4	I saw this book for the very first time, while browsing through a book store in London Heathrow airport. Honestly, what caught my eyes is the name of the book. Unlike all other books I read about Hinduism, this book is very simple. I read the whole book during my flight from London to New York. This book answered all my questions I had about my culture my culture as well as my religion. I also learned so aspects of Christianity also from this book. The book also helped me to answer all type of questions my Christian friends ask me. Now when they ask me, "Why Hindus worship many gods?" I can answer them, "Hindus worship the one and only God - Brahman which express itself in many forms." When they ask me, "Why Hindus worship idols?" I can answer them, "Like every one else, including Christians, Hindus use idols or icons to concentrate on God who has no name or form." I can also tell them that Hindus believe that every person who search after truth will attain salvation [ self-realization] irrespective of whether he or she is a Hindu or Christian or Moslem. Am I A Hindu? is indeed a book for Indians born in the west who are desperately trying to learn about their faith. In short, AM I A HINDU? Is a great book for anyone who wants to know everything about Hinduism. An amazing book without any dogma or demagoguery.
1	1	This is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about Machiavelli's major works. What I wanted, however, was to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote, and I would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond Florence. If you understand references to the founding of Rome, to 15th century Papal politics, and have a good grounding in Livy, this book is for you. If, like me, what you wanted from a introduction to Machiavelli was to have someone explain Machiavelli's context and allusions, look elsewhere
0	0	This book was disappointing because it was billed as a raw cookbook and it is not raw. Get Juliano's "Raw" and "Rawsome" by Bridgette Mars and "Green for Life" by Victoria Botenko instead
3	3	This is not a typical read for me, but I enjoyed it. I read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time, but when I hit chapter 44, I read the rest of the book in one sitting. Loved Max, Frannie, Kit & all the others. Looking forward to reading "The Lake House"
1	1	Since the end of the Cold War and the virtual eradication of the two other great political ideologies of the twentieth century, namely Communism and Fascism, the victory of Capitalism has earned it the right to proceed unmolested and, to a very great degree, unquestioned in its dissemination to every point on the globe. This, as Samir Amin author of The Liberal Virus aptly points out, could be dangerous. Capitalism is a system that has always been based on the Darwinian principal of survival of the fittest and as such "can produce nothing other than an intensification of the inequalities between people." True. So true. And anybody who takes the time to actually study Adam Smith's, The Wealth of Nations, will see that the twin engines supposed to drive a Capitalist economy are greed and competition, with very little regard for the actual well being of humans. This should come as no surprise, as a quick look around at the current champions of Capitalist enterprise in America like insurance, energy and telecommunications will readily reveal. Any thinking person must agree that it is at least worthwhile to keep a cautious eye on the current trajectory of unfettered Capitalism, and inquiring into its possible dangers is undoubtedly healthy. In fact, what's needed is a measured evaluation of Capitalism as it exists today, both good and bad, with the kind of unflinching exploration into its darker implications provided by Samir Amin here. But in the current American political climate where knee-jerk Conservatism hold sways and the petty ranting of narrow-minded demagogues is counted as reasoned political discourse, this is no time to inject an analysis of Capitalism with anti-Americanism and hand-wringing over the demise of Socialism. A book like this advances the issue with only the most restrained and open-minded readers and, for the rest, drags the debate back into the muck of Cold War hysterics. Not only does Amin reveal himself as a whiney, vindictive Socialist who would love nothing more than to see America brought to its knees, but he is an obtuse and turgid writer of the kind only academia can produce. There were sentences in this book I had to read three times before I could figure out what he was saying, and his annoying habit of loading his sentences with digressive clauses, parenthetical clarifications and coined words, had me grateful that this book was only 112 pages long - I have read 300 page books that took me less time to get a handle on. All in all, The Liberal Virus explores some issues much in need of inquiry but does so in a way that is so off-putting that it cannot gain much traction among American readers, no matter what their stripe, and can only serve to hinder the debate. What we need is a book about Capitalism that can open minds, not scare them closed or befuddle them with the liberal self-indulgence of its author.
3	3	I hightly recommend this book. An easy, quick read that could change your life
1	1	Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun
0	0	A ferocious beast that loves Mickey Mouse? Capable of ripping two armed policemen to shreds? Capable of eluding the Marines in the wilderness? All these talents and the final encounter with this terrible monster is so anticlimatic it made me resent having wasted my time with the novel. And the ending . . . . horrible. It was as if Koontz thought the audience of this novel would be teenagers looking for something like R.L. Stine would write. I'd give it a half a star if I could
4	4	Although many readers have commented on Elizabeth (a truly captivating character), her husband Isaac has been given short shift. He appears in one of the book's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the Rosh Hashana dinner and, in an act of private accounting, chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store. Analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text, Isaac then resolves to mend his ways. This scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious Jewish sensibility (surpassed, in my reading, only by Chaim Grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant "Rabbis and Wives").
1	1	Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music. As far as I know, this is the only book about him. The book doesn't go into a great amount of detail. The discography and selected reviews are worth reading. I'd say your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get your money's worth..
0	0	...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it.
3	3	It is a great book for young ones to learn about Shapes. My 13 months old son is not in to shapes yet but I will use this book onces he learns about shapes. Buy this book if your toddler already can recognize the shapes and can sit with you while you read this book. It is a activity book.
0	0	I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
4	4	The successful companies are not afraid to confront the problem when it arises and discuss it rationally. Even though directed more toward a business or office atmosphere, the same techniques can be applied to family and friends. The example stories cover a broad array of possible circumstances, which will help when conversations turn crucial (or critical). The chapters flow well, with a touch of humor. The skills can be easily learned. Chapters 1-2 are an introduction; Chapters 3-9 details how to use each skill; Chapters 10-12 is a summary and contains advanced study tools. The authors believe good communication skills (talking, listening and acting together) start with the heart. To some these skills may seam obvious, but they are also meant to boost or to rid ourselves of years of bad habits. They will then become more conscience as practiced. First is to recognize we need this book. Then we need to utilize it and build our communication skills to make them habits. I believe it is safe to say that most who pick this book up will come away with an improvement in some area. "To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often" --- Winston Churchil
4	4	With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers. As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective. Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10). As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan. Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media. Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world. As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable. I found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.

4	4	Henry Fielding wrote SHAMELA for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. The fact that Richardson's earlier PAMELA had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. In his preface, Fielding makes it clear that he has placed Richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. He attempts to expose "the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela, Are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless Arts of that young Politician, set in a true and just Light." He makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether Pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary Fielding sees as the latter. Like PAMELA, SHAMELA is a novel (much briefer than PAMELA) written as letters. But in Fielding's hands, Shamela is seen as the master manipulator. Where Pamela faints whenever her Mr. B. grabs her, Shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. With each passing episode, Fielding inverts the moral universe of Richardson so that when one considers Richardson's subtitle of PAMELA as "Virtue rewarded," one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of Pamela and the virtue of Shamela are alike only in their spelling. I am glad that I read PAMELA first, for if I had come across SHAMELA first, I am pretty sure that I would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic.
1	1	I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that
4	4	This will appeal to many people, from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story. Myself, I always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society, and the story of vaccination is terrific. Aside from the fun aspect of this book, Mr. Allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children's autism was caused by vaccines. There has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue (particularly by people like Don Imus--he should be ashamed of himself), which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child's disability. I hope very much that Mr. Allen's work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation
0	0	Lots of data, but the story to tell seems to have never been found. The findings are really not that interesting
1	1	The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired. The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents. Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to. The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book. You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused. If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher
3	3	Unlike the first Repairman Jack adventure, THE TOMB, which was horror/science fiction, this one is a straight mystery. Wilson does try his best to shamelessly tug at your heartstrings, tossing in some abandoned babies with AIDS, and also some child pornography. Add a modern-day Japanese samuri, some American mercenaries, some Arab villains, and you've got is a fast-paced novel that could be made into a pretty good movie
3	3	This is a wonderfully written book. There is a section for every person to find something of interest. There are several new things to learn here. It is written in a very mature fashion and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable whatever your reading about
0	0	After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be. Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others. I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination). What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world. Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull. I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent. But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did). She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her "coolness" factor. Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either. If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy. If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick
3	3	This is essentially a grammar, but it leaves out the simple basics and continues where a school grammar would stop. It assumes that you master the hiragana and katagana alphabets, but for the kanji there is almost always a pronounciation guide. It takes time to read, as the text is concentrated, but it's not difficult, and one gladly reads one chapter after the other. Generally it's both interesting and useful
1	1	This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences. That's about all it is. Pretty, well constructed sentences. The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake. The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered. At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told.

0	0	Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed
4	4	Ivan Lansberg's new book is an excellent resource for anyone living through, or helping to manage, the succession process in a family business! The book is thoroughly scholarly yet practical...it is &quot;a must read,&quot; for anyone interested in the subject. It is the best book on the subject I have read
1	1	In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack. In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip. "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him. Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had. Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications. This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling. But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe: 1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result. 2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by. 3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar. 4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices. This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean: "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32) "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91) "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97) "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110) "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123) In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book. Rennie Petersen PS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul)
0	0	I love to read, and have all my life. I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book. I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it. I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it. You'd have to use a microscope to find it. Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting. I don't have a problem with that. My problem is Mary herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book. I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on. Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book. At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something. In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice. Watch the movie. Forget the book

0	0	I personally believe Dr. Dyson has the best interest of black folk at heart. I really do. However, I think he is misguided and I am not impressed by him. I admit I did not finish the book. Once he began his personal attacks on Mr. Cosby I left it alone. Bill said what many of us say in private. Period. You can argue that he picked the wrong time and place, but the message is the right one. Maybe he did not say it as nicely as he could have, but it is still the truth. At the end of the day there are way too many writers and speakers trying to pass themselves off as leaders. Leaders lead, writers write, and speakers talk. The sad thing about it is so many of our people incorrectly accept these people as leaders. There are too many people trying to tell us what to think and not enough showing our people what to do. While Dyson beats Cosby down personally I ask what should some of these young brothers do to better their situation? There are basically two kinds of people in this world. You either look for people and things that confirm what you think to be true. Or you look for people and things that will reveal the truth rather it confirms what you thought or turns it on its head. At this time our people need the truth, not more pandering.
3	3	I found this book to be very well written and easy to understand, for the most part the book will take you by the hand in modeling a character (using 3Ds Max 3). If you are a total newbie you will find this book easy to comprehend and follow wish in my opinion will set some foundation for you if you wish to buy and read more advanced books on the subject. On the downsize the book does a little attempt to explain texturing a character and doesn't go in deep in the process of designing the textures of the characters. But all in all a pretty nice book for entry level character design
0	0	I found that if you want to learn the language of auditing, have another reference handy. Often, the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation. There were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented. I also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed. Also, figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that didn't apply to the new scenario
4	4	I recently discovered I have multiple food allergies. This cookbook has been extremely useful. I have tried about a dozen recipes in the past 3 weeks. All recipes have turned out well, and have been very tasty. I would recommend this cookbook to other allergy sufferers. I found the sections on the different flours and how to rotate my diet very useful
1	1	I have recently completed reading BabyWise II. I consider myself a Christian and this book is extremely popular in my church. Throughout the entire book, I had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods. However, by the end, I realized that I should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child. While I believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book, I had already found much of that advice in other sources. For example, feeding schedules are advocated by many resources, but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies' basic needs are met before implementing such routines. With my knowledge from other resources, I attempted to read BabyWise with a bit of grace, but at the same time I felt guilt and coercement at many points; for instance, when I realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended' by Mr. Ezzo for a child her age. For the record, my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age. This concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and I asked him to read it. He read only the forward and immediately became suspicious. He asked me if there were any references and I instantly realized there were none. It then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword, and that Mr. Ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development. A very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions, and we found many articles against Mr. Ezzo's methods, including a well documented student's masters thesis. Out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book, I performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own (four books; all of which document research for their claims and advice) and found absolutely no negative press for any. Based on how unclear I found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice I had to sort out, I strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first. As I said, I don't disagree with all of the methods and advice, but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient (not a bad thing) children and has no other qualifications beyond that. You could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire. As we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently. Please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child. Just an end note: As popular as this book is among my friends, I have not known anybody to follow the BabyWise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues, and there is a good reason for that: Not all of it is good advice
0	0	If you read this book -- you can thank the author for making you dumber. If you spent money on this book -- you can thank the author for wasting your hard-earned cash. If you enjoyed this book in any respect -- then you can thank the author for her talent in writing fiction. Not only was this book chock full of crap, it didn't at all confer with the people involved to get the facts straight. This is all hearsay and press coverage that anyone could dig up googling the subject matter. Now, if you believe what the press tells you -- then you're a real sucker
4	4	This is an unbelievably great edition of The Canterbury Tales. All I wanted was the original, complete version with definitions for archaic words. But the Penguin Classics edition was all I could find, so I got it. It comes with over 500 pages of extras!!! Super-detailed notes, a great glossary, and lots on Chaucer, his times, literary genres, etc., etc. Multiple interpretations are given for parts scholars don't agree on. I can't believe I paid $80 for the Riverside Chaucer in college! ...which I later sold back for much less. This edition blew me away, and it's relatively cheap. If you haven't read Chaucer and want to read him in old English, it's tough at first, but it gets easier with practice. There are long tales, short tales, noble tales, bawdy tales, etc. If you just want to read a few, there are cheaper paperbacks with just a few. If you want the complete tales but not the essays and things, they exist, but they're more expensive than this edition
4	4	This book is not a history in the since of most history books. It does not detail how the academy began, or how it changed over the years, or give you any kind of insider view of its workings. Instead, it is a complete listing of every nominee and every winner in every category since the award ceremony's inception in 1927. There are plenty of photographs of the nominees and images of scenes from the nominated films for each year, so it is not dry in the way many reference books are. In fact, Mr. Osborne's love of film and its history really shine through in the book. It is interesting to look through this book and see what we consider to be films that have withstood the test of time versus which ones were rewarded by the academy at the time. For example, in 1939, the Academy did recognize that "Gone with the Wind" was the best picture of the year, which people were lining up to watch in movie theaters until its television broadcast premiere in 1976. However, in 1941, "How Green was My Valley" won best picture, which is a film that hardly anyone watches anymore, while "Citizen Kane" was completely ignored. It's also interesting to see how the Academy compensated for past oversights by awarding performances that were less than stellar in subsequent years. For instance, in 1934 Bette Davis was overlooked in her performance in "Of Human Bondage". This caused a huge public outcry. The following year the Academy gave her the best actress award for her performance in "Dangerous"- a move that has largely been seen over the years as a consolation prize for what happened the year before. This book is full of little insights such as these, and it is a fun book that gives hours of entertainment for film history buffs. I bought my first copy of this history by Mr. Osborne back in 1987 when he was then detailing the 60 years of the Oscar, and I enjoyed it so much I have been updating my copy every time he releases a new edition. Highly recommended
4	4	A wonderful story of devotion! Mem Fox continues to be one of my favorite children's story tellers. Hunwick is a sweet little creature who remains loyal in spite of others' misgivings. The use of so many animals strange to the Americas makes the book even more wonderful, with delightful pictures to help with the story
4	4	How could I have missed HUNWICK until now? He is a rabbit-eared Bandicoot, one of an endangered species, familiarly known in Australia as the BILBY. *Aussie* reviewer "LIN" won me over by suggesting that "Hunwick's Egg" would be a great Easter gift. Hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch. They are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug: a cockatoo, an echidna (resembling a porcupine), and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of *Bryll Cream* . . . Hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen! But still the egg does not hatch. The plant life is gorgeous, drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils. I am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus, and other green wildflowers. After referring to my dictionary I felt tricked into falling for a RAT, of all things. I don't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature! The more important reality is that HAPPINESS CAN ERUPT FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF RELATIONSHIPS. It is remarkable how loneliness vanishes when you can share your burrow. Reviewer mcHAIKU recommends that you make sure you have an Easter Basket large enough to accommodate this precious book
3	3	IMPERIAL WOMAN is the fictionalized biography of the great Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, the real power behind the throne during the reins of the last four emperors of China. The story starts with her as a beautiful Manchu teenager who, along with her cousin Sakota, is picked for the emperor's crop of concubines. Through guile and ambition, Tzu Hsi bears the male heir to the emperor she comes to control. When the emperor dies young, Tzu Hsi makes sure she and Sakota are named regents for the young child emperor. Through keen intelligence, intrigue, and whatever other means necessary, Tzu Hsi holds the imperial throne through her son's childhood. Buck portrays a woman split between feelings of love for her family and what is the best for the empire, rather than what I gather is the historical feeling - that Tzu Hsi was some sort of evil spider spinning schemes from the center of her web in Forbidden City. Through all the machinations and years she is aided by Jung Lu, her former betrothed and the love of her life. The Dowager Empress has the ultimate power, but Buck shows she is a servant of the opinions of her court advisors and in reality only rules the eunuchs and court ladies in the Forbidden City. She is a relic of the past in a time of great change and cultural upheaval in China, when it is besieged by western nations and ideas. The infamous Boxer Rebellion is the beginning of the end for Tzu Hsi, and she loses her spirit and resolve after this defeat and the death of her beloved Jung Lu.
1	1	I thoroughly enjoyed reading Nancy's book, and it sounded as though it would be the perfect answer for my fitting problems. But, when I tried to utilize her techniques, nothing fit at all. It was a big disappointment
4	4	Having studied the work of Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) and read more than half-a-dozen works on him, I came to "God's Choice" with a significant cache of knowledge on the subject. While Weigel's work and social commentary (perhaps best known through his syndicated column) remains a source of contention and, at times, controversy, I was rather pleased with this book. I believe that the major fault of the work rests in the initial focus on John Paul II (which occupies more than 100 pages of the 268-page book). Like David Gibson in his "The Rule of Benedict," Weigel apparently felt it necessary to remind the reader of all the great details of Benedict's predecessor - a task I find to be superfluous. That said, it is a good book. I was delightfully surprised at times while reading this book to find that Weigel had occasionally rendered his advisories an appropriate level of respect. Citing John Allen, Jr., (chief Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, often noted by being at ends ideologically with the views of Weigel) and others, Weigel significantly avoids polemical spin in a way that has garnered new respect from this reader. However, it should also be noted that there remains a peppering of Weigel's clear and present agenda throughout the book. While at times is appears fleeting or subtle, reader beware that his ecclesial and cultural politics surface here and there. Perhaps one example would suffice. While addressing his opinion of a "progressive Catholic movement" and its possible Cardinal-elector representatives, he makes the unfounded and impertinent remark: "That, in turn, may explain why the progressive project is infertile - increasingly unable to attract the brightest students in graduate schools of theology in the United States." (Weigel 136-137) Without any substance, using vague terms, Weigel makes a sweeping statement regarding the state of graduate theological students - as it pleases him. All in all, this is a wonderfully written work. Weigel is clearly intelligent, while politically transparent, and his writing style engages the reader. I would recommend this book as a companion volume to the many other works dedicated to elucidating the life and work of Benedict XVI (see John Allen, Jr.'s "Pope Benedict XVI," H. J. Fischer's "Pope Benedict XVI: A Personal Portrait," and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger's "Milestones.")
0	0	I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy. Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined. With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects. Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks. At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is. I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects. I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made. The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest. We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house. Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.
0	0	The Professional Edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new Photoshop CS2 features; Smart Sharpening and Reduce Noise. It has sections on Sharpening and Noise BUT does not cover the new CS2 commands. I have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise
4	4	This was the first Nora Roberts book that I had read and it is now, I think, my most favorite book I have ever read. I have never been interested in reading a romance before, but this struck me as being different and it was! It has romance in it difinately...very good romance I might add...but it is a thriller! I couldn't put it down and I'm not kidding! I read this book in a week and it normally takes me close to a month because I just don't have that much time to read. I found my self MAKING time to read THIS book! It is very graphic with the murders, rapes and animal killings, but reading that kind of stuff doesn't really bother me. It's seeing it in a movie that I can't handle. But I think Nora Roberts knew what she was doing by making it so graphic. You just want to KILL this guy, and you find yourself prying your eyes open even when your exhausted and want to go to bed just to see if maybe on the next page you figure out who this guy is. Not only is the suspense awsome, but her characters are great. You just really get involved with them and really feel what they feel. I loved reading about the girls learning to run a ranch, ride horses, and heard cattle and stuff like that. Everything about the book is just awsome!
4	4	This book was required reading at our office and at the time I wondered why, after all we had a great team! After taking the assessment test I realized we had lots of room to improve! The story was a quick and easy read but very effective. We implemented many of the ideas in the book and work much more effectively today than we did a year ago. Thanks for a great book
1	1	The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world. The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving. My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental. I know that the chamber of horrors at the "mental hospital" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear. And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences. As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know
4	4	Insightful critique of the Qur'an and related materials on Mohammad and Islamic history, current events, and terrorism. A introductory work of great breadth. A must read, for more than purposes of Christian evangelism. For those who want to preserve the West
4	4	A side of Michael J. Fox rarely seen. An inspiring story of how someone can rise above their difficulties and turn it into a gift to help others
4	4	Tempting Tropicals is a horticultural tour de force, packed with detailed information about growth habits, propagation tips, and the soil, temperature and light requirements of more than eight score tropical plants. The fascinating, well written text is ornamented with full color photographs of these exotic beauties that marvelously display each plant's unique attributes. The superb text and photos are presented with the exacting production values that the publisher is well known for in the gardening community. This book is a must for all real phytophiles

1	1	There are some good hints here, but do not be mislead by the title. For a complete book on Disneyland and California Adventure, I highly recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003, Expert Advice From The Inside Source. Birnbaum's Disneyland is updated annually and published every year
0	0	This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy. I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned. I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed. After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines. To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.
1	1	The subtitle of this book, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa, is completely deceitful. There is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists. It is rather a chronicle of the Japanese film industry, not without interest in itself. However, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading. While the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources. Meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of Kurosawa and Mifune. The author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself. A simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book
0	0	This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section. I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either
1	1	If you are that "Dummy" who wants to know how to build a web-site, then this is not the book for you. It tells you hardly how to build, it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool. You have to have some HTML cq Dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify. By reading the book and going through the enclosed CD Rom with ty-out software, I soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading. See comments above why. If you are that "Dummy" who has not a single thread of knowledge about building web-sites, then do NOT buy this book. Not giving it 1 star (but I was close), there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude, but typing what you want to have inside your web-site (links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around 50% of the book). you will get the same information from any search engine. Recommendation: concentrate first on a book, that teaches you the basic HTML-programming language, continue then with either a Dreamweaver/FrontPage manual. You're much better off..
0	0	Maybe this book contains some good advice. But I gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it. I seriously doubt I'll make it all the way through the book. The first part of the book talks about Michael Gerber's (fictitious?) mentee Sarah, a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and can't get up. The conversations between Michael and Sarah are so contrived and syrupy, who can believe them? Sarah needs to climb a mountain in Nepal, discover the meaning of life, and get it over with. The second part, which I'm reading now, is structured around the 7 "disciplines" for building a company. I skipped ahead to this part, but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that I really feel lost not having read it. If you like business story books of the Patrick Lencioni variety, you MIGHT get something out of E Myth Mastery. But be warned: This book as many times longer than Lencioni's, with a lot less meat
1	1	This book could be a great book for the unergrad intro to structures course. It has a nice writing style, it is easy to understand, and has plenty of example problems. However, it is FULL of errors. It think someone in my class would find a new error at least once a week

0	0	My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron. I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge. Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song. I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time. Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real she still was upset for the rest of the night. I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it. I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it. I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well

4	4	I used to be a good friend to Rush. I listened to his program all the time. When I first saw this book, I ignored it. Finally, after it had been in the window of our bookstore for several months, I picked it up and looked inside. I was amazed! However, I had to put it down because I thought it was too negative. It called Rush names. I did not need to have that. Finally, I tried getting it at the library, but they said they did not have a copy, because they said it was "too controversial." So when the price came down, I bought a used copy for a couple of bucks, and read the whole thing. I was amazed some more! Rush used to have 20 million listeners to his talk show. He was a legendary, rich talk show host. This book tells you exactly how Rush became a rich, popular talk show host. And he is thinner now that he has recovered from his unfortunate drug problem. And you know, that sort of thing could happen to anybody. But I had trusted Rush, and his VALUES, and I kind of felt he let me down. So for me, the title is not appropriate. Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Rich Talk Show Host who Cuts Corners on His Values would be a better title. Rush is no idiot, either. Now, by some "coincidence" Al Franken is a talk show host too. And, I bet he learned how by studying how Rush did it! If Franken can do it, YOU can do it! Don't miss out on this GREAT opportunity! Get a copy. Look how cheap it is now. Tell your friends
1	1	This is a nearly verbatim rendition of the Grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why Zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children. Even harder to figure out is how the American Library Association could award its Caldecott Medal for distinguished American picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: The king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king, whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized "servant girl" to save the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. A weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with Renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad

3	3	One only need read the reviews of this book from both professional and amateur critics to see that, if Gross's purpose is to aid the reconciliation between Jews and Poles, he has utterly failed. Unlike books dealing with heroes who surmounted prejudice to create miracles, this book stirs an old cauldron of hatred, freshening the pot. Readers without a more complete history of both the Jews and the Poles are especially at risk. Jan Karski's "Story of a Secret State" which was actually written DURING World War 2 and deals with the situation in a balanced and informed manner would be a good companion book to this. Additional reading should include a comprehensive review of Polish-Jewish relations, beginning with the Charters of Sanctity responsible for so many Jews living in Poland in the first place. When Jews were being blamed for the plague and slaughtered throughout Europe, the Poles opened their doors and gave them a homeland, where they thrived for many centuries. The Lutheran armies of the Swedish invasions brought anti-Semitism. Later, Poland was divided by Germany, Russia (with a German Queen), and Austria, an occupation which lasted for more than a century. These countries waged a cultural war on the occupied Poles, determined to convert them to their own. The Poland of WW2 had only been liberated for a few decades. The equivalent of Ronald Reagan's era to today. Many of the citizens were of German descent and actually aided the Nazis in their fight against other Poles, not only Jews. And although the sickening atrocities recounted in this book are inexcusable, one must keep in mind that they were committed by people driven to collective madness by decades of oppression, poverty and terror. We've seen similar episodes in recent years in the Balkans and Africa and elsewhere. Even the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem maintains a website decrying violations by hate-infected Israelis today. Poland has only regained her true national and cultural identity in the last two decades, after two hundred years of occupation. Pope John Paul 2 was emblematic of that spirit, and Poland's support for Israel and attempts to honor her Jewish heritage, embraced by her youth of today, are evidence that she has turned a corner and is nurturing the great ideals of her past. The Poland that was once a mighty power, yet never imperialistic. The Poland that was the Promised Land for Jews in the Middle Ages

4	4	This is an excellent and accurate account of a horse that learned to spell and do simple math. It is also an amazing story of the emancipated slave who trained him. It gives an excellent history of the time after the civil war. It changed my view of what is possible. I was taught in psychology 101 that the horse Gentle Hans was a fraud and that he had learned to pick up unconscious cues from his trainer, that he wasn't really able to think. Beautiful Jim Key proved without a doubt that he was able to spell and do math and make change. Wonderful history
3	3	When I first discovered that a new Burton biography by a professor of history was soon to be published I had high expectations. Upon receipt of Professor Kennedy's Burton biography titled The Highly Civilized Man, I started digesting his work. The asserted themes of the work included 1) placing Burton and his work in context with the larger issues and challenges of Victorian times, and 2) using Burton to better understand the nature of changes beginning to percolate socially due to the interaction of Victorian England with its colonial enterprises. Indeed, as far as I know, this approach is pioneering and insightful. As I continued reading to about page 90, I thought Professor Kennedy's effort was well done, and the book would be another jewel to adorn the crown of Burton research, along with the work of Mary Lovell. I am of the opinion Professor Kennedy succeeded in achieving both this stated objectives. From this standpoint, his book is a success. The observations of Burton as a harbinger bridging the transition from the Victorian Era to the Modern Era reflect the type of insights one expects from a biographer trained in the rigors of academic scholarship. I enjoyed the in depth academic analysis of Burton from the standpoint of concepts of relativism as applied to notions of cultural difference. Professor Kennedy has also highlighted the role played by Burton in the early development of anthropology as an academic discipline. Social/Cultural Anthropology's primary research methodology is called participant/observation. Certainly, this approach was an inherent part of Burton's nature, and the scope of his anthropological observations were derived by this research approach. I was also glad to see that Professor Kennedy gave particular attention to discussing Burton's Stone Talk and his Kasidah. The earlier biographies did not devote much attention to either of these important works. As long as Kennedy stayed focused on academic based scholarship he avoided the pitfalls that plagued the earlier biographies that predated Lovell's Rage to Live. Unfortunately, the book digressed into complicated histories that are not fully recounted. Yet, Professor Kennedy felt compelled to make several definitive conclusions sorely lacking the professional level of scholarship a professor should be required to meet. The outcome of Kennedy's failures is a setback in Burton scholarship. Given the effort to place Burton in context, the irony is that the book with notable examples omits necessary context to understand and evaluate some of the Professor's conclusion. For example, the recounted history of Burton firing over the head of a crowd of Greek Orthodox Christians fails to acknowledge that Burton resorted to this solution after trying less violent alternatives, and after he and fellow members of his party were injured by rocks thrown at them. The key point is that Burton used a hierarchy of options to confront unstable situations. This point also relates to the absurd conclusion that Richard and Isabel were role-playing in the desert, and that there is a hidden psychology to uncover. The decision to have Isabel act as Richard's son was an attempt to protect her from rape and death, and to give Richard an option before resorting to lethal force. The Burtons took their personal safety serious as illustrated by their habit of carrying two revolvers and three Bowie knives when traveling. Professor Kennedy has a mildly obsessive theme about people Burton did not know going into the desert for homosexual interludes that randomly pops up in the book. He includes a discussion of Burton and several earlier biographers who speculated about Burton's sexuality. But Kennedy failed to note those writers assumed Richard and Isabel had a loveless and sexless marriage, and they used outmoded, almost now quaint, modes of Freudian analysis. The illusion of the Burton's loveless marriage was gutted by the original sources brought to light by Ms. Lovell. Professor Kennedy fails to point out the deficiencies of Brodie and Mclynn concerning their analysis of Burton and sexuality. The deficiencies in The Highly Civilized Man about the question of Burton's sexual interests are too numerous to address in a short review nor are the issues he raised concerning Damascus, Crowley and others. Kennedy's treatment of Burton in Damascus is a travesty. Not once does the professor inform the reader that all segments of society in Damascus worked to bring Burton back from his recall. The Damascus treatment is lacking in necessary detail and skewered to the degree that the discussion should have been deleted form the book. It is also one of the examples where Kennedy included information that is extraneous to accomplishing his two professed themes. The book appears to have been written with segments produced using an academic analysis methodology with other portions written in an almost stream of consciousness with points lacking critical evaluation. Moreover, there are instances of contradiction. This leads one to conclude the work was not scrutinized properly before going to press. The Kasidah analysis includes a conclusion that Burton believed there is no God or afterlife, yet in the chapter titled the Afterlife, Kennedy indicates Burton may have concluded there is continuing life. In fact, towards the end of the Kasidah and towards the end of note 2, Burton makes it plain he has a positive view on a continuing future life. It is not a life however with the attributes of anyone's religious acculturation. The chapter on the afterlife in large part is one of the commendable aspects of this biography. All of the hallmarks of a work that will withstand the centuries are present in this work if only the good professor would later reissue it, and correct the many deficiencies and expand the themes of Burton as harbinger, Burton as catalyst, Burton as a pioneering mystic and Burton as scribe in the manner of Thoth, the Ancient Egyptian principle of wisdom.
0	0	I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read. The whole plot is just plain ridiculous. Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime. When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years. Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is? Avoid this one
1	1	This book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. The YI Jin Jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. Neither is the Shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. I don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. It is very vague and elementary, a lot like Smith's other books. The fighting methods shown are a poor representation of Shaolin skills. The true essence of Shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from Taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book
4	4	'The Dog of the South' is a perfect novel. This sounds like hyperbole. It is short; there is very little in the way of plot; the characters do not develop in any way: yet the book is as engaging and entertaining as anything I have ever read. Before embarking on my second reading (just a fortnight after I finished my first) I planned to write down my favourite lines from the book. I gave up because I was transcribing almost the entire novel. No synopsis can do it justice. Ray Blount, Jr. has said of this book that 'no-one should die without reading it.' I'm with him all the way
0	0	I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much. It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder.
0	0	It is because of this book and the other books James Fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack, that people have lost so much interest in the JFK Assassination. Honest authors like Harold Weisberg and David Wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up. The Z-film was altered, many know this, the Warren Commission published it in volume 18 (18H1-84) with frames missing. In case you don't know this, that counts as alteration. Z-film tampering was not to the extent that Fetzer claims such as painting Jackie's face on the film itself. The film was not stolen, or doctored up in anyway. No one would be dumb enough to take that risk
4	4	I just finished this book (for the second time, actually) and enjoyed it just as much as Reilly's other books. The hero of the story, William Race, is what many of us would like to be: a regular guy who, when thrust into extraordinary situations, very capably becomes the hero. Of course the action is over the top and unrealistic. It's supposed to be! I tell everybody who asks that Reilly is the best action writer I've ever read. I'm not sure why some people blast his books so bad. Do a little research and know what you're getting into. If you like high-powered, non-stop action, this is the guy for you. If you're not, then here's a clue: DON'T READ REILLY'S BOOKS!!! Sounds pretty simple
1	1	This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system. This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times. I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe. But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends. This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting. The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much. The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times. As a result, the book became a little boring. I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across. About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review. The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers. Secondly, I did not like the book. Plain and simple. That is OK. Not every book jives with everybody. I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring. I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus. You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you. I am free to express my opinions on these books. And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life. You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me. So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers. I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it. I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other
0	0	I am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man. However, when I first came across this book a few years ago, I was offended and frankly, shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book. Whoever the author may be, s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is NOT to insult black men, who represent her brothers, her father or her friends. Another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth, when it stated that historically, it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [...], and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her. Half of me believes [or wants to believe] that this book is actually a satire. I hope one day to have my hopes confirmed!
1	1	I do not quite understand why this should be a recommended Buk-Book. It is a fairly interesting interview, alright. But if you're going to spend money on Bukowski: buy HIS books.

Pivano's Interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money
1	1	Sigh... Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts. Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line. This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing. So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score). The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form. For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about. So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out
4	4	Whether you've already used up the previous two Spanish guides in the Practice Makes Perfect Series (Spanish Verb Tenses, and Spanish Pronouns and Pronouns), or this is your introduction, this workbook is as good as it gets for the intermediate to advanced student of Spanish who wants to keep learning beyond the classroom. Complete Spanish Grammar has it all--friendly, down-to-earth language, exercises that could have been taken right out of Hispanic shops and streets and living rooms, and explanations of grammar components that actually make sense. I don't know how many times I've heard the exact phrases I just saw in the workbook while walking down the streets of Mexican towns. And since it's soft-cover, it's easy to take with you and work with while traveling. Hey, at $10.95, you can even afford to buy and extra one to keep in the car.

1	1	OK, Mr. Koontz, Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence. This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment. Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again. Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs. What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz? Are you losing your mind? Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush. I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so. That seems to be around the time that you became a kook
4	4	Firstly, I must say that it is very difficult to summarize this book in any way. The complexity (and importance) of the material is such that there is no substitute for a direct, mindful read. However, if you are looking for a very worthwhile attempt at summarization, I suggest you read the review by ABC "bb" (I was persuaded to purchase by this review). Many reviewers have commented that "Choosing Reality" is an "easy read". While I do agree to an extent, it seems necessary to note that these comments are true only in relation to other books of the same nature. Considering the complexity of the subject matter, yes, this book is an easy read. In comparison to most literature, however, this "easy read" statement is perhaps less plausable. My point is this: do not expect this book to be simple (firstly, because it isn't; secondly, because it shouldn't be). This is of double importance if the reader is of a traditional, Western mindset. The content of "Choosing Reality" (especially the latter chapters) takes time to fully absorb. In fact, this book was, for me, the anti-thesis of a 'quick read'. That said, I must say that I enjoyed every long minute of it. Wallace does a wonderful job showing the flaws in scientific realism and instrumentalism, chronicaling the histories and the theories of each. He then thoroughly explains the comprimise, the middle way, the Buddhist way: a centrist view of reality. While the presentation of the centrist view was invaluable in its own right, the most enjoyable sections of the book came after this presentation. Wallace undertakes the very difficult task of using language to describe how the centrist view can be applied to our lives. Rather than just offering a theory, he describes how the centrist view deals with the mind, the nature of "physical reality", and the illusory "self". The author earnestly argues that the implications of the centrist view are real; implications that will certainly force you to re-evaluate the world you live in. The beauty of this book is that it caters to any audience. There is enough science to make it rational and reasonable; there is enough Buddhism to make it real and applicable. I consider this book of utmost importance to anyone interested in modern physics, Buddhism, the nature of reality, and/or the self. Finally, I must note that as much as this book is a religious view of science, it is equally (albeit more subtly) a scientific view of religion. As perhaps Wallace's greatest triumph in this book, modern science and religion are shown to be infinintely complimentary, both ultimately striving to understand the same things: the nature of reality and our role in it. To this end, "Choosing Reality" is a must read
4	4	This is the start to a story that will bring every emotion out of you. The characters, landscapes, different worlds, languages, fantasy, majic all tie in together and create a simply wonderful journey for a reader. To read this book and the entire story, please keep an open mind, let your imagination runn wild, and remember that this is a story that came out of a writer who struggled with this for 23 years yet he leaves enough for you to decided a lot of things for yourself. All the loose ends become tied together so keep reading. But above all read the books for the story not the ending, but I promise you'll be suprised and hopefully as I was, incredibly enlightened.
4	4	While this was not as good as its predecessor HLNO,it was great and provide follow ups on our main guys from HLNO. It was sexy and sweet, lots of teasing it will definelty leave you hot and bothered. There challenged in many ways which makes the end all the more speacial. I am really looking foward to the next story I feel it maybe even better than this one! Enjoy its worth the rea
1	1	Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with
1	1	Despite the praise heaped on this text, I can't help feeling that Bernard Faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. It is by no means certain that the Ch'an (Zen) tradition has functioned as Faure suggests. Why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural' argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? There are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by Zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. Sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, Faure style.
1	1	The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again.
0	0	Huh? What happened to the ingested fig? To the excrement in the park? To the severed thumb buried in the floor? Yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. What happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? To Wally for instance? Atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending. For Amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite "Shadow of the Wind" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century Europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one

4	4	A lyrical and beautifully written narrative of the struggle between the local railroad workers' union and their French overseers during a strike against the Dakar-Niger Railroad. Set in 1947 this novel describes a timeless environment which has gone unchanged in post-colonial West Africa. Given the hightened awareness of the plight of Africans today this novel gives a great insight into the history and background of their deprivation and poverty
3	3	McCammon delivers an excellent short story collection. You will get hooked on his writing style immediatly. There is plenty of gore and twists to even keep R.Laymon fans satisfied. The short story entitled : Blue World is somewhat of a spoiler in the row of brilliant horror storys of which Chico is the best
4	4	I liked this book alot, it was very different and it gave me alot of ideas of books to read based on what &quot;mood&quot; I am in. It also gave me some insite to some of the books that I have already read, and how they perceived the books
3	3	I bought this book with low expectation for both the poetry and the story. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. Emperor's Babe is sexy, stylish and just the most original book I've read in ages. The heroine is a tough little customer, a hip Afro Roman living in Londinium who meets the man of her dreams and loses everything else. By the time you come to last page I promise that you will be moved by her story

4	4	My aunt recently came to visit me and strongly suggested I read your "Don't eat the marshmallow...yet!" book along with the Motivational mini book. Since reading the book (just two days ago), one effect your book had on me was to set up a savings account that will transfer funds from my checking account twice a month. My aunt, along with your book, also inspired me use passages and quote some lines that I am using for my midterm paper. I wanted to thank you for the inspiration and additional motivation (that I YES needed!). I am continuing the domino effect and am recommending this book to my friends and even my boss. I will continue re-reading this book and adopt the marshmallow theory/delayed gratification as my own.

0	0	I was so disappointed by this book I could not get through more than a couple of chapters. The author may know about mountaineering, but he seems to know very little about Kenya. Moreover, I found the writing to be ethnocentric and quite boring
4	4	My 4 year old son and I stumbled across this book in the library and I immediately knew we had to have our own copy. The poem that constitutes the text of this book is simple and timeless. The illustrations are breathtaking. Each painting depicts the same train at the crossing, the various townspeople waiting at the crossing and the contents of the freight cars. My son loves inventing 'conversations' between the people waiting for the train to pass. A lovely book that is a nice addition to any child's library
0	0	I have Cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history, which was not passed down in our family, so I got this book to read in good faith. The author makes us sound like a bunch of backward, bloodthirsty, superstitious people, and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous (...). There is little in the book of the trail of tears, and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author, who believes he can mind read for people dead over 150 years. When he does get around to the actual trail of tears (the last sixth of the book) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were, and gets into how not that many people really died, and the Federal Government is being portrayed in a bad light historically. He also portrays the Cherokee Nation's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book, treating the Cherokee as a quaint, dead culture and people. It saddens me that college students are being given this to read. I learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book

0	0	Should be titled 'Art of Selling Products, Making Hundreds By Manipulating Prospects'. Excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off. A big disappointment for fee-based planners or advisors looking to expand their client base. It deals more with manipulating prospects over the phone than with practical face-to-face financial services sale
1	1	This is the favorite book of a friend of mine, she rereads it every year. She chose it for our bookclub, and the rest of us hated it! I think this is the best example I know of a book that either really connects with you, or doesn't at all. I have a degree in Eng. Lit. and certainly have encountered a number of books written in an unique or poetic style that I loved, but this one was for me rambling, full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and, since I didn't like a single character, I never felt invested in anything that happened to them. For others what was tedium for me, was poetry. I made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub, but it was like taking medicine--still I can see that every word was a joy for my friend. This isn't a matter of being good or bad, its obviously a masterpiece for some, but if it isn't your kind of writing, you will find it more than a chore to get through
3	3	As a high school teacher I was surprised and pleasantly amused to hear that Jon Stewart had decided to make a Teacher's Edition of anything. When I found out that a colleague of mine had decided to buy the book and reference it in a History class I thought that I should look it over and see if it was worth its weight in satire. It is definitely worth its weight in something. I find that The Daily Show's viewpoint is refreshing and that Jon Stewart's attempts at unraveling the political veil is essential to what we consider Democracy. The Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction is a good reference and cocktail party conversation starter. I think that most of the book is interesting but I wouldn't want my child to come home and quote verbatim some of the blather that is inside. As a book for the masses sure. As a book intended for teachers no. I suppose that is the joke of it all. No teacher should use this text as a real reference or they would probably end up on 60 Minutes or The Daily Show explaining why their students were arrested for harrassing Supreme Court justices with naked pictures
4	4	A confession of an Economic Hit Man was excellent book on the United States government raises to global dominate via corporation American and private organization. The push for global dominate has been forced upon Americans through education, and media outlets.
0	0	May I first applaud Dr. Schneider in seeing the value of alternative treatments as opposed to traditional medicine. However Dr. Schneider as with most Md's is not a good source of information on alternative forms of treatment. Md's are lucky in their 1000+ hours of education to get one 1/2 of a class on nutrition and alternative therapies. Therefore their knowledge base is close to nil. Most of the stuff he lists is mainstream knowledge. His research is not complete and most of it requires you to talk to your MD first who in turn would very unlikely recommend anything natural. However, because Americans have a love affair with their Md's they spend 244 BILLION a year on drugs. This in turn has made Dr. Schneider's profession one of the top five leading causes of death in the nation (JAMA). Because of this Md's who are seeing a shift away from traditional medical care can capitalize immensely on this shift in care by billing themselves as experts. I'd recommend someone who has MANY years of experience in nutrition and alternative therapy. Nutritionists, Naturopathic Physicians, Ayruvedic Physicians, Doctors of Chiropractic and Osteopathic Physicians are much better sources of info. Think about it.
3	3	Although this book has been written almost 50 years ago it still provides basic insight into our behavior in the modern world. 'Money, prestige and power are the main incentives today for the largest section of our population - that which is employed'. This probably holds still today whereas some of the major concerns of the fifties are not concerning people any more. A book to read and think about
0	0	Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.' The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability. Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom. Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.
0	0	Page after page and line after line, this book is amazing in its power to frustrate even the most gawky-eyed initiate in the world of espionage-reading! Philby says pretty much nothing that will add to our knowledge of his ways and mechanics of operation. He is a fine writer, without doubt, but good writing befreft of content? He does not wax expansive on his faith - communism; he does not explain the hows of his first contact with the KGB; he does not even offer a strand of information on his life in Moscow, his marriage, his routine... aww, come on ... Pick it up and read it one three-hour layover at the airport... then place it in your library so that you have a book (for the record) that was written by THE spy who outdid 'em all!
0	0	Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over
0	0	President Ulysses Grant called the 1846 U.S. invasioin of Mexico, "the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." I see whatever piece of the "American Dream" that immigrants (legal or not) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations. Pat Buchanan has said, "if people don't want terrorism, we have to give up our empire." I think he's right, I'd just add that the same goes for immigration. To curb the influx of economic refugees, we have to reform NAFTA, end the exploitative behavior of transnationals (many US-based) in the maquilladoras, support Fair Trade, end the dirty work of places like the School of the Americas and figures like "Economic Hit Men," and so forth. Moreover, Wooldridge and others often speak as if the "Minute Men" are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration. Thankfully, there are groups like the American Friends Service Committee and Border Links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration, and far more humane approaches to this complex issue. As General Smedley Butler said, "war is a racket," and that includes this war on immigrants. There is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence, aerial drones, motion sensors, videocameras, detention centers, and the other equipment of a police state. If we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well, we won't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave. Rather than Wooldridge's fear and resentment-mongering, I'd recommend the upcoming boook by Free Speech Radio News host, Deepa Fernandes, which is titled, "Targeted: Homeland Security and the Business of Immigration." We could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of Mexico's own movements for justice. There are many books and DVDs available regarding the courageous efforts of the Zapatistas.

4	4	How is it that the Oakland A's have won the AL West in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll? That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball. One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas. It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news. The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up. Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others. And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning. When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point.
4	4	Along with Belinda and The History of Sir Charles Grandison, essential reading for all Jane Austen enthusiasts. In Camilla you will find Austen's inspiration for many different characters and situations. The 17 year old heroine of the novel is Burney's most enchanting. Her adventures are rich and surprising.The color of the 18th century infuses this book. Bring handkerchiefs, for there is pathos aplenty, but in a pure, non-cloying form. Eugenia, the stunted and unlovely but spiritually and intellectually exquisite sister of Camilla provides the soul of the book. This book contains suspense, glamour, romance, great wisdom and greater folly. Anyone who adores 18th C lit. will be sorry to turn the last page, though a thousand preceded it. In many ways this is Burney's happiest and most hopeful book. It was written as she was celebrating her liberation from spinsterhood into the estate of a married woman at age 40. We would be very lucky if anyone ever thought to turn this one into a film

1	1	Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did. I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable! It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness. Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty
4	4	I've seen several not-so-good reviews of this book so I wanted to write a good one. I'm not finished reading it yet, but I only have about 60 pages left and I've read enough of it to know that I'm thoroughly enjoying it. There are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny and other parts that are so detailed and insightful that I am enjoying this novel on many levels. If you like authors whose writing is what I call "quirky" (a little on the weird side but I mean that in a good way...interesting and funny details on almost every page), you'll love this book. I know that my local library has at least three other books by this author and I intend to get every last one of them during my next trip to the library. The kind of quirky, comical, insightful writing that I like is best represented by the following book, which I actualy bought instead of borrowing it from the library, and I don't buy books very often: A Girl Named Zippy: Growing Up Small in Mooreland Indiana by Haven Kimmel http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767915054/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-1969313-5510321?v=glance&s=books If you liked "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Elizabeth Berg, you will absolutely love "A Girl Named Zippy" by Haven Kimmel
4	4	Greene has clearly drawn out the ways of the seducer. Most of the men and women in here are naturals at seduction and are not consciously doing the principles taught. But those that tend to mess up their seductions can learn quite a few things from these people. With everything i teach at my site The Seduction Bible, i still believe that this book is excellent for those looking to score that one special girl. Those wanting to learn how to go out to a bar to pick up a woman are better off on sites like mine. But this book deserves 5 stars
0	0	I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all. When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!! ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books??? Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things. Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them. My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.
3	3	In England though she recently broke up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year-old Charlotte feels good about herself and her future as she is doing well in school, lives in a relatively happy all female home, and seems adjusted. That is until she learns she is pregnant. Her mom Karen is a teacher's aide struggling with her mother Nan's mind slowly slipping away with the demands from that side already overwhelming. Her patience is over the edge when Charlotte informs her she is pregnant. Upset and unable to contain her anger, Karen cannot believe that history has repeated itself because when she was sixteen she gave birth to Karen. Though she loves her daughter all her dreams died with her birth. She did marry the father but thankfully divorced that loser soon afterward. As Nan drifts deeper into the past including insisting that she adopted Karen, the mentally exhausted sandwich generation is not sure what to do as Charlotte decides to give birth except to flee in search of her biological mother dreaming of a loving comforting welcome. This fascinating character study is at its best when the audience sees deep inside the three generations with deep understanding of being an unwed mother, a child having a child, the sandwich generation, and the creeping of dementia (as well as a late stroke). When the tale spins off into the biological mother twist it loses some of its depth until Karen returns to her "real" family. Somewhat a soap opera, THE BAD MOTHER'S HANDBOOK is a strong family drama that focuses on the demands and responsibilities on women without men. Harriet Klausner
0	0	Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details
1	1	I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut
1	1	Gives many examples of Weapons, most of which are useful. Gives no/few examples of Rings/Armours/Rods/Staffs/Shields Doesn't really think out a lot of the bonuses, also I question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a Legacy weapon. About the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2. Sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole SLEW of HP. The rest of them are so painful they aren't worth taking. Also all the caster "Tables" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn't make any sense. No matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it. Those could have been more thought out. Also I question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, A, D, and G. Seem to be a lot better than the B, E and H tables just from the way they interact with things. I do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your Legacy item is quite powerful, the I table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them. What I wish/want was if they're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two I table skills. Also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid. The rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers. Are very well thought out and are very powerful. Yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable. In a Caster heavy campaign like the one I run and participate in its a very low value book
4	4	existence and perception in a phenomelogical sense; that is, physical health, emotional well-being, and spiritual contentedness are ways of describing aspects of one single, non-local reality. He advocates an approach to Western allopathic medicine which seriously examines the conditions of one's emotional and spiritual health. Why? Again, the state of one aspect of a person's reality influences, or perpaps even determines, the state(s) of the others. Dr. Dossey, in essence, is presenting an introduction to developing a healthy and homeostatic relationship within the world of an individual as well as the world in a very universal sense. A highly recommended read
4	4	The best book for college grads to read. Written by real people for real people. It's a MUST BUY!!
1	1	I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar. A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors. I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels. From the term "your library" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description
4	4	this book is really good on many levels.theres really 2 stories going on.1 is how these 3 kids spent thier summer this one time,which is its more endearing side and the other story about this chick that got raped and how a racist town wants to pin it on this black dude.then theres this creepy boo radley guy and all in all its a great book.one of those you have to have read to call yourself educated about literature
4	4	Another in James D. Doss' Shaman series which began with The Shaman Sings in the mid 1990s. The series started off good and just keeps getting better. Doss marries a wry writing style with well-drawn characters, a clever story line and a fine understated humour. His setting is southern Colorado, a land of ranchers, wide spaces and capable country people both matukach (white) and Ute Native Americans. The Shaman of the series, wise old Ute Daisy Perika, doesn't feature to the extent that she has in other books in the series but her contribution via dreams and premonitions is subtle and true. Her character is the stuff the series is built on. She is abrasive and annoying, and takes pleasure in being so, yet the writer has made her irascible while likeable and she is the character the reader will remember long after the rest are forgotten. The story's central character is Charlie Moon, nephew of Daisy Perika and a Ute rancher and sometime policeman for his tribe. Charlie's major trouble in life is a mountain cat terrorising his ranch workers and cattle, until he is asked to find out who injured a U.S. Senator and at the same time killed Billy Smoke, the Senator's driver. The Senator, who runs the neighbouring ranch, has his own agenda and Charlie finds himself also involved in investigating a leak of damaging government information from the Senator's ranch. Charlie finds himself often on the tricky side of guns and dangerous animals (both human and not). It makes for a rollicking and thoroughly enjoyable read. No sex but some violence
4	4	"Don't Play In the Sun" by Marita Golden ***5 Stars This is a very disturbing subject, especially if you are lightskinned like me. Luckily, Marita Golden handles it with a lot of tenderness and care for others. I liked Marita Golden's book more than The Color Complex, because her life story gave it a specially intimate dimension. I would recommend this along with anything by Kola Boof, an Ethiopian author who has really been bringing this subject up in ways that literally stop the blood in your veins. Her novel "Flesh and the Devil" breaks this issue down but it's not for the squeamish. She's like Hardcore compared to Marita Golden and most authors I've read. I'm going to read "The Bluest Eye" next. "Don't Play In the Sun" is a NEW CLASSIC. People will be reading this for years.
1	1	Not quite the crapfest that was book 3 in the Ringworld series, but still a gigantic disappointment coming from Niven. Children is plagued by the same things that made the previous novel so unbearable: flat, uninteresting characters, ridiculous names, obsession over interspecies sex for no reason other than to include sex in the story, and overall a poorly written plot. To be fair, I didn't come out of this one as bewildered as after Ringworld Throne - don't even ask me to summarize THAT plot, I've yet to come across a decent one myself, mostly because trying to figure it out can cause lasting brain damage. But even so, this novel is nowhere near the original Ringworld novel, or even Engineers for that matter. Avoid if possible
4	4	These days, you don't see many people with the interest or guts to do what Jon Stewart and his co-workers do. In America, the book, they aim to teach misinformed Americans what their government is really about. Many people don't actually know what the heck goes on in the government, nor do they care. The book, filled with hilarious tidbits, great explanations, and well thought out presentations, aims to make the government interesting. It's got history, how the government works, modern day conflicts, theories, ideas, people, and what our Founders did for this great nation. It should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen. Jon Stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this. They went against the grain and did what they knew was right. It's our duty as Americans to criticize the government. When there's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it, you have the responsibility to fix it. Hopefully this has changed America
1	1	So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin. There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural, mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.
4	4	This is a fantastic book! Richard Feynman is a fascinating person and an excellent writer. His view of the world is exciting and interesting and his life experiences make for enjoyable stories. One lesson that comes through in this book is 'Think', don't be afraid to stop and think about something, a problem, a point of view, etc. Through these stories and the life of Richard Feynman, we are all shown what it is to live a life well. Get this book!
3	3	Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, has created a successful series based on a few basic principles. The first, and in my opinion, most important aspect is a fascinating heroine, who presents different layers that the author has been revealing in each installment and will certainly continue to do so. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a tough cop, who is relentless in her pursue of justice and feels as if the victims were hers to save. On the other hand, she is the wife of the billionaire Roarke, and has to deal with parties and charity events in which she is expected to mingle and maintain polite chit-chat with the guests. She has been adjusting slowly to this area of her life and even though she does not like it, she has learned to accept it. The fact that Eve was abused by her father when she was a child and had to kill him in order to escape also plays an important role in the development of the story and in almost every case Eve faces. Her husband also has a complex past, involving an abusing father who killed Roarke's mother and then lied to him about who his real mother was. Only recently did the billionaire learned the truth about this and reunited with what was left of his family. Besides the two main characters, Robb has created a supporting cast that adds appeal to the series and which I consider to be the second factor in its success. Peabody is Eve's former aide and current partner who has recently made detective and who usually adds a good part of humor to the narration with her witty comments. She is in love with McNabb, a policeman working in the Electronic Detectives Division, and they are in the process of moving together to a new apartment. There are other interesting characters: Feeney, Eve's trainer and mentor, Mavis, Eve's best friend, Nadine Furst, a reporter for Channel 75 who has become a close friend with Eve, Charles, a licensed companion who is now dating a doctor, and several others. One of the most appealing aspects of the series has to do with the development of the stories of each of these people, and that is why I recommend reading the series in order. The third and final element that helps create a superb series is the cleverly crafted world in which the action takes place: New York in the year 2059. The setting presents several characteristics that make it very different from our world, like cars that fly, drones that take care of household chores, the ban on firearms, the anticancer vaccine, the legalization of prostitution, the difficulty for getting real coffee, etc. Also, the advances in terms of technology require criminals to be more clever and careful when committing their crimes, and we usually end up reading about complex mysteries. In this novel, Eve is summoned to the scene of a ghastly murder. The victim was raped and strangled using a red ribbon and before leaving, the killer took out her eyes as a memento. The poor woman had a four-year-old kid and worked as hired help for a wealthy couple, and there is nothing that indicates that someone would have wanted to hurt her. Everything is business as normal until Celina Sanchez shows up wanting to talk to Eve and claiming she has information about the murder. Celina is a psychic and claims that she saw the killing in a vision. Even though Eve does not really believe in this stuff, she goes along with it following Peabody's advice and realizing that if it does not help at least it will not hurt either. This is not the first time Robb uses supernatural events in the series, but in her previous attempt she went too far making it hardly believable. In the present try the results were much better, and since the case Eve is facing is one of the best mysteries in the series so far, the overall quality of the novel benefits even more. As usual, Robb creates a good balance between the police procedural and the development of the personal stories of the characters in the series. Of course, the romantic scenes are still present through the narration, but without overdoing it. I was very pleased with this installment, and I am looking forward to the next one. A final word of advice, the publisher's blurb gives out important information regarding events towards the end of the novel. I would have preferred to read the book without knowing these facts. The good thing is that even if you read them, there will be a surprise waiting for you
4	4	For anyone interested in birds, birdwatching, or following your dreams this is a good read. For a teenager to have such a year as recounted here and be able to write in an entertaining way is truly a treat. Highly recommended
4	4	Penelope Fitzgerald is at her most devilishly entrancing in this tale revolving around the London acting school run (and I mean RUN!) by Freddie, a larger-than-life Gorgon whose will cannot be resisted. Fitzgerald has fun skewering the backstage pretentions, intrigue and petty jealousies of the London theater world of the early 1960s, but, clearly loving every seedy corner of it, she celebrates it with such gusto that you want to sign up on the spot for a season or two. That combination of wryness and fondness makes this short novel among Fitzgerald's most satisfying. And when Freddie goes out looking for a pound or two, hang on to your wallets
0	0	6 volume series? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages, but he's so long winded with everything. And reading this feels like i'm standing at the front door with Jehova's Witnesses. Ender's game was great. It deserves 5 stars. But i'm almost convinced it was written by someone else
3	3	The "Thief Lord" is a wonderful contemporary story full of loss, beauty, adventure and a little bit of magic. Cornelia Funke's book has one several literary prizes and even bumped Harry Potter off the best sellers list in Germany and Northern Europe for a time. It never talks down to kids and is engaging to adults as well. The imagery of Venice is dead-on (just like I remembered) and the characters(Prosepero, Scipio) are richly portrayed. This is a story that is light on the fantastic but heavy on imagery and imagination just like the classics! The main protaganists are boys but boys and girls can enjoy this book equally as there are a few standout female characters also. Geared to young readers 8-12 and also adults
4	4	Baseball fans with an affection for the sports history will relish the renewed examination of Babe Ruth's life and career, which packs in almost a hundred photos to supplement anecdotes from those who knew him. Readers will find here an affectionate examination of Babe Ruth's life and times along with a fine visual coverage of baseball history
1	1	This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading. I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book. But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end. That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel. This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form. This is unexcusable in my opinion. I just don't get it. I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages. I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book. This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
4	4	This thick soft-backed "pocket" book has 490 pages. It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems. I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment. Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time.
4	4	Mr. Gilkerson has written something wonderful here; even 50 pages in and at the tender age of 40+ I was enjoying the ride. This is one fun book to read, and aside from some of the nautical terms used, seems very appropriate for an early adolescent. Also, as a hobby pirate historian, I can fully appreciate what the author has done in providing a background for the history of piracy in his narrative. He has provided this history in what I consider to be a very engaging manner; a manner that will drag the younger reader along entertainingly and educationally. Three hundred plus pages later, I was just as engaged as the author wound up his narrative. There are only a couple of minor things that could have been included to help the young reader: 1) a glossary of terms, 2) a labeled image of ship rigging, and 3) a collected bibliography for further reading. In the end, those are fairly minor points when considered in the context of the overall entertainment value of the book. My hearty thanks to William Gilkerson for entertaining me with this splendid tale. P-
4	4	As I am a scholar and an expert of Na-Dene groupings, I find this to be one of the most fascinating and remarkable volumes of THE HANDBOOKD OF NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS. The photos and linguistic data are absolutely fascinating and the authentic information -that so captivates every micro-molecule of my attention- is astonishingly elating! I have recently been able to determine -thanks to the many rare and authentic photos of this book- that many of the Northern 'Athapaskan' tribes are not totally 'mongoloid', as I had previoiusly surmised. I have discovered Indian (from 'India') and Turkish strains that are especially, concentrated in northeastern British Columbia and northwestern-Northwest Territory bands. These findings have shed much light on my Na-Dene origin theories, regarding the genetic makeup of the Na-Dene forbears. AWESOME!!
3	3	Fareed Zakaria rightly forces his readers to think harder than they usually do about the interdependence existing between freedom and democracy. In the West, constitutional liberalism, with its checks and balances, gave birth to modern democracy. However, too much democracy can paradoxically lead to less freedom. Think for instance about humiliated Germany after WWI under the Weimar Republic and its subsequent mistreatment of different minorities for specious reasons under the Nazis. Similarly, more choices can result into less accountability. Think for instance about those who fail to plan financially for old age independent of a social security system increasingly at risk of insolvency due to shifting demographics. In the U.S. and overseas, right without responsibility is usually as immoral and unjust as responsibility without right. Unelected bodies such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the World Trade Organization are a necessary evil. Expertise of their respective members is judged more important than their democratic legitimacy to hopefully pursue the better good of either a human community or a society of sovereign states. These unelected officials are not held accountable to the tyranny of instant gratification that too many elected officials perceive, rightly or wrongly, among a majority of their constituents. Because unelected bodies are a necessary evil to account for human weaknesses, they should remain the exception rather than the rule. Pleading for an increase in unelected bodies, though well-intentioned, could paradoxically lead to a weakening support of the best-in-class in their respective categories.

There is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and STAY clutter-free.
3	3	This is one of the best books on fencing writen by an American. It's major weakness is that it often attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . The author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored. This book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers; not a good read for beginners . A good book but kept me wanting more, for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it's done for her. Close only 4 of 5 stars

4	4	This is a fascinating book about one of the best (relatively)young directors working. As usual, Mr. Parish has done his homework. The background material is great and helps give a really vivid picture of the person. I really feel I got to know Mr. Van Sandt from reading this book, not only him, but his family and associates growing up. The descriptions of his early works are especially interesting. Mr. Parish is one of the most thorough writers when it comes to work credits of his subjects. I also enjoy this section of his books. I definitely recommend this book
1	1	This book does start with some slight promise. It has a touching opening chapter. And it follows the life story of one of its villains, who is a very unlikely, over-the-top character, but who nevertheless will probably win your sympathy and may even break your heart. The book also has plenty of Cornwell's trademark technical detail. You will be treated to a wide variety of how-to tips on everything from how to fly a helicopter, to what gun to carry for different law enforcement jobs, to how to identify watermarks on paper. But overall, I found this book to be a big disappointment. First of all, the book is riddled with egomania. Almost every chapter contains some lavish adulation of the protagonist, Kate Scarpetta. Almost every character oozes adoration of Scarpetta, lives only to win her respect, longs for her, even in planning to kill her seeks only to unite with her in ecstasy. What's all this about? Since Scarpetta is so clearly Cornwell's alterego, a reader can only conclude that Cornwell herself is getting lost in a cult of personality. However, Scarpetta doesn't appear much in person in this book. She remains a presence, inspiring others. When she does make a personal appearance though, the book's tone of adoration doesn't mute into any more seemly modesty, as would seem appropriate when an author is in essence describing herself. If anything, the deification of Scarpetta intensifies in these scenes. For example, a man observing her, notes how deliberately she does everything. Even in the act of reaching for her coffee cup, he sees her "exuding confidence and power." Really, all this reverence for Scarpetta turns these pages into absurdity. Even apart from their hero worship of Scarpetta though, many of the other characters in the book are manifestly improbable, or even impossible. A book could perhaps stand one over-the-top villain, such as the bizarrely afflicted one I mentioned in the first paragraph of this review. However, most of the characters in Blowfly, evildoers and presumed good guys alike, are leading lives of such mythic proportions, that the book loses all touch with reality. Scarpetta's niece, who has been an on-going character in Cornwell's books, turns into a full-blown cartoon superheroine here, with preternatural command and capabilities across international borders. One of the actions this niece involves herself with in this book is so outrageous and of such questionable morality, that this subplot would seem more appropriate as back-story for a Nintendo game. There are also specific stylistic problems with the book. Cornwell has often used the technique of short chapters, snapshots of sorts, interlacing the actions of the different characters. The technique can be a valid one, building suspense while you are briefly diverted from one character's pending homicide, to the less crucial actions of some subsidiary player. And the technique can be used like a mosaic, to build a picture tile-by-tile. But with Blowfly, the chapters have become so short that it seems a mere pandering to readers' presumed short attention spans. I'll admit the TV ad pace of the book kept me going through to the end. Snap. Snap. Snap. Now this. Now the other. But I'm not proud of my growing addiction to this kind of hit-and-run narration. Then there's the persistent, occasionally jarring use of the present tense - in a context in which this couldn't all possibly be happening in real time. And there are too many ongoing, hackneyed analogies between the brain and various machines. Cornwell has always liked these comparisons, but they become constant pebbles in the shoe here. "No frontal lobe alarm sounds" rang... "...her brain can't process"... "jerking her mind out of gear"... Finally, there is the problem with the book's ending. It's as if Cornwell ran out of paper, or else was ordered by her publisher to simply turn in her manuscript, finished or not. All her knowledge of CSI investigative technique count for nothing in the end. None of the plot threads get really integrated into coherence. So there are a few good things about Blowfly. You get to inhabit another serial killer's mind and daily squalid living conditions with creepy intimacy. There are also some interesting psychological insights into the motives of female accomplices or "enablers" of such men. There are things to be learned about defense weapons. But these good things get swamped, like the dead bodies that fall into the bayous of Baton Rouge where much of this book's action takes place. Overall, I'd say if you see this Blowfly coming your way - get out the flyswatter!

4	4	Great! It was about time that the biggest monster of them all was exposed. "Biggest", not simply because of the unprecedented number of deaths that he caused, but because he was so utterly trivial. As Jung Chang/Halliday show, he wasn't ideologically inspired, he had no liking for his own country and its tremendous culture, and he couldn't sustain mature relationships with other human beings. His motivation was apparently selfish, spiteful and capricious, like the school bully who finds himself running the school. He let the Chinese people starve, while pumping resources abroad to pay for military technology or win the approval of Third World tyrants and "liberation movements". Again, great! Because this book may remind us in the West just how foolish many of our bright young people were back then. On the political demos of the Sixties, the Maoists stood out for their brutality and brainlessness, and total lack of any sense of humour. Many of the intellectuals of the time seem to have been either fooled by Maoism, or bought. They did dirt on the values of their own culture while (figuratively or literally) waving the Little Red Book. Most of them have moved on, but this book might just remind them of creepy behaviour that they'd prefer to forget. Finally, two criticisms that have been made of Jung Chang/Halliday by some reviewers. Firstly, the lack of balance. Well, was there anything remotely attractive about Mao or the things that he did? He "reunited China" - yes, but that doesn't mean that without him it would never have happened, in fact some of the political opponents that Mao destroyed along the way might, given the chance, have presided over a far less monstrous regime. Secondly, the journalistic style of the book. True, occasionally it lapses into cliche, but the text remains accessible and easily readable for anyone who wants to know more about Mao. Compare this with Mao's own turgid platitudes, or the incomprehensible screeds of Marxist intellectuals. Let Mao have the last word. In 1940 he wrote the following, and one might stop to consider how he lived up to this commitment to the Chinese people, and at what cost to them: "It is not hard for one to do a bit of good. What is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad, to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses, the young people and the revolution, and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end. That is the hardest thing of all!"
1	1	I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead
0	0	The book is worthless. It was extremely high level and should have been titled &quot;configuring windows 2000 server security for dummies&quot;. This book is not for anyone with Security or W2K experience....move one and don't waste your time or money
0	0	No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would. Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance? Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system. 90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's "progressivism" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one
0	0	The manual helped my husband in writing his reports in the APA format. The only thing he recommends is that there should be more examples in the book. At times, he has to search for the items that were not clear in the internet
1	1	If you've read her Amanda Quick novels, this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel, "Scandal". Heroine proposes to hero, who has a hidden agenda. Of course he's rich and he has almost the same history as "Scandal", whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt, and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father's friends/business associates want paid right away. Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path. The book is so similar that a couple of times I caught myself looking at the cover to make sure I had the right book. The only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time
1	1	The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all. The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest. There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
0	0	I bought the Panther edition of this book, and found it contained a great deal of useful information. However, I felt it did not serve well for a reference material for two reasons... 1. This book is huge. It needs to be perfect bound or made into two separate volumes. 2. Though the index is quite extensive, there is no way to adequately search the book for troubleshooting Mac OSX. Both points would be obviated by the inclusion of a CD containing an ebook, preferably as a PDF. I reported this to the publisher, but apparently they disagree since this version does not include a disc. For this reason, I have decided not to purchase this book until future editions include this. I'm writing this here in hopes that the publisher will read this, and act accordingly
1	1	I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on. I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life

0	0	Would the woman writing under Joyce Carol Oates' name these days please return America's greatest living author to us? Seriously, this was the most unenjoyable, in fact most distressingly bad, book by Oates I've read, among the maybe thirty I have had the utmost pleasure to read. I don't know what vein Oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all, the stories themselves are unimpressive, unwelcoming, unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration. And worse still, I find this is a trend with Oates these days. I can't think of a single book she's published since Middle Age that has been (yes, strictly in my opinion) any good. The short story in Female of the Species that was called "Madison at Guignol" was perhaps the worst Oates story ever published. (And yes I do understand the connotation of the word "Guignol" in the title.) Some might accuse me of approaching Oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what I, myself, wanted, but that's not the case. One thing I have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people. I have avidly read along thru Gothic stories, mysteries, romances, non-genre pieces, novellas, poems, short fiction, novels, literary criticism and plays by Oates, and so I believe I can fairly say I do not stereotype Joyce Carol Oates or expect any one thing from her, but in this case, as much as reporting it pains me, this was a bad book and I can only hope Oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has, and that her next book(s) will be much better
0	0	I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back. It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out. I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would. Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes. But, I would not waste the time if I were you
1	1	Pros: Someone recommended this book to me, and when he did, I asked him why in the world would he think I'd be interested in a book written by a cop, specifically because I've never made it a secret that I do NOT trust police and I'm extremely burnt out on the Biggie/Tupac's death considering I wasn't a fan of either of them. He told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on Biggie and Tupac. Indeed, he was right. This book delved into the Jam Master Jay killing, along with the criminal issues of Murder Inc., Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, Diddy, 50 Cent, J. Lo, Lil' Kim, Foxxy Brown, Suge Knight, Snoop, Game, Dr. Dre, etc., in addition to the murders of Freaky Tah, Tupac, Biggie, and more. It was interesting to read about the details that I did not hear in these cases, such as cops handcuffing J. Lo to the top of the cage. That's a prime example of why I feel the way I feel about cops. Was it really necessary to do that? In that aspect, I can feel this book. There were many times when Parker complained about how the NYPD handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals, and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the NYPD continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk, the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game. Cons: 1) I'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor, I can look over errors. It's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one. I'm hoping that's what happened with this book. No copyeditor will catch every single error, but about a quarter through this book, I was seeing so many errors to the point where I wondered was it copyedited at all? Commas out of place, words in the wrong order, past tense with present tense, and other glaring errors that should've been caught by even the most casual reader. 2) I was so tired of this man patting himself on the back. It was to the point where I thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was. He kept italicizing "I" and "me" as if we didn't understand that he deserved credit for something. Then, he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop. In mid-story, he'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject. Okay, we get it. If the man had just told the story and his actions, we could've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your Hip-Hop Superman Cape. 3) Over and over again, he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of. The word "accidentally" and "Amadou Diallo" should NEVER be used in the same sentence. That was flat-out intended murder; nothing accidental about it. Even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence, he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate, without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that. He uses examples like Kanye West to say that some rappers don't go down the same violent path, but what a drastic comparison. Kanye West didn't live nearly the life that Snoop Doggy Dogg did and there's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many "gangsters" and drug dealers have in how they view life. This is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time, but I can't see how he couldn't understand that. 4) Throughout this whole book, he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong. Even when he does, he blames it on his boss making him do it (ex. creating the hip-hop binder). He claims he's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he doesn't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun. He talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden, violent areas of Brooklyn. That in itself concerns me. To me, that's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game Clue. He may find it amusing that he caught the killer, but none of these killers, witnesses, and children in the area find their everyday life "fun." It's very easy to criticize one's lifestyle when you don't have to live it on an everyday basis. 5) The man seems to have all of these answers about how the NYPD and LAPD should operate to be a more productive police force, but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the "Why I Hate Cops" attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before. There's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas (and quite a few middle-income areas too, the more the police act a fool)! Every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases, he gave out real names of witnesses, as well as ALL the information they gave. He talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories. But the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public. Some of the killers got off free, and I don't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book. Does he think all criminals don't read? All they need is ONE friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book, and there's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses. Victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them, and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops. If anything, it makes them more hesitant. Just about every chapter, I was shaking my head and thinking "He can't help it. He's a cop. He doesn't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information." Even if it's someone who hasn't been in a situation where they have to be a witness, a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person's nerves to the point where they don't want to help you simply because they don't like YOU. I went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed ALL the time for unexplainable reasons, even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl. It's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities. Cops have to pretty much change their WHOLE attitude before a lot of these people will trust them. 6) He speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how Jay-Z and 50 Cent have marketing deals. I don't even understand this comparison. It's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes. They both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them. Yes, they were both drug dealers IN THE PAST. So what? Is every marketing company supposed to look at their background, ignore the fact that they are legit now, and not do business with them? If that's the case, America wouldn't have survived this long. This country was created from thieves and slaveowners. If Wall Street can get rich, so can hip-hop. Parker talks about how most Fortune 500 companies wouldn't do business with people with this background. I hate to break it to this dude, but if companies weren't going to get rich off of criminals, America wouldn't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of FREE labor and the attitude "well, it's all in the past now." As I figured, I didn't like this book and it didn't improve my opinion on cops, but when he wasn't talking about how great he was, I did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports
0	0	I very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that I could be done with it and move on to a different book! I found this book pointless. After reading 482 pages, I can't even think of two adjectives to describe Sally and Clare. Moody does such a poor job of character development that I don't feel like I know all that much about these two women. I did not like the main characters and I didn't feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all. The book is way too long, the plot is unbelievable, the characters are unlikable, and the writing style is annoying
4	4	This book has something for every event in a garden. Planting, designing, what to grow and how to grow it. It is one of the most useful gardening books that I have on my shelf and use it often. In the winter its great to read and work out any previous season problems and plan for the new year
4	4	"The Andromeda Strain" may be an antique in science fiction, having been published in 1969, but that hardly diminishes its excellence. The caliber of Michael Crichton's research is such that I still found the technology and science in the book impressive (though the computers were obviously dated) despite the book's age. The plotline is thrilling, and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy, most are equally fascinating. I was slightly disappointed by the ending; however, the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it

All fault finding and no solutions. If Malkin really was a conservative, she wouldn't have shown her intolerance to others.

0	0	After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs. The only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the "man" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read
3	3	The book The First Part Last by Angela Johnson is a story about a teenage boy and his life as a father. In his sixeenth birhtday his girlfriend gives him some new that changes his life forever. The story flips back and forth from present time to the past so you can predict at times why certain things are the way they are. his story seems very realistic compard to what many teenage fathers go through. In the story he finds it hard to balance his school work and taking care of the baby, especially since his parents do not heop much. Finally he ends up breaking down and gets in trouble for it as well. This book shows the struggles of teen pregnancy and what many teen fathers and mothers go through. If you enjoy this book you would probably enjoy the book Hanging on To Max as well
0	0	I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy. But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer. I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity? Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk? That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic. Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon. If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch
4	4	My 19 month old loves this book. She is a huge Elmo fan and loves it when he says, "Elmo loves you." Any young Elmo fan will enjoy the book, although the reader will probably grow weary of it quickly
4	4	The book arrived in good condition, and is indeed a hip-pocket sized book
1	1	I don't understand why this book has the ratings of the other reviews here. It is a big disappointment. While this book has some interesting tips between the lines (that's why I give it 2 stars instead of one), it is merely a rambling of a self-important producer. The 303 "solutions" are at best 303 anecdotal stories. Take solution #96 "How to Shoot in a Boat" for example, it reads, in its entirety "I always seem to get the jobs of shooting from some kind of moving vehicle. You've read my exploits in the air and on the ground, but what about in the water? Shooting footage from a boat is a skill that someday I will master. Not wanting to delve into jet skis, Ski-Dos, or speedboats, I will be discussing motorboats and sailboats." Great solution Chuck! That really makes my filming much better. Perhaps it would be possible to cut down this book into 99 tips and solutions, but in the style its been written it would still be painful to read and extract useful information. Furthermore, the cover says, "solve any video or edit problem in 10 minutes or less". Not only is that untrue but also shows how silly this book is. The picture of a consumer DV camera also has nothing to do with the content, because Chuck uses big professional equipment throughout this book, stuff that takes more than 10 minutes to just unpack by the way. I haven't found a good book to suggest as an alternative yet, but don't waste your money on this one. Try any other
1	1	I've read and often re-read most every PJ book and column ever written. I've always liked this guy. I keep his books after I've read them instead of taking them to the local used book store. "On the Wealth of Nations" did not work. Honestly, it sort of skidded into a ditch and got stuck from page one. It reads like the meeting minutes of a local book club. It's not so much PJ, it's the concept of taking possibly one of the country's biggest early day doorstops of a read and then having a top-end writer in the 21st century translate it with some political satire and humor for spin and flavor.. It just doesn't land. What may compound it all is that PJ's writing doesn't have quite the sharp edges on it as it used to. Age brings that on in all of us. PJ hasnt quite hit the grumpy ol' man part of his career yet. To take a book like the Wealth of Nations and do a think-tank review on it is asking a lot of any author with any style or talent. PJ gave it a go but honestly, I yawned a lot
4	4	The book delivers what it promises: a modern look on the abramelin operation and the possible procedures involved in obtaining the so called knowledge and conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel, samadhi, or whatever your label of choice is for this ineffable experience you are after. Just like "The New Hermetics" (another title by the same author which I sincerely recommend for those with an interest in magick and/or NLP...and how big is the difference between the two after all?), 21st Century Mage keeps an eye on the past and tradition, while at the same time cutting through whatever may be superfluous, and keeping a very effective, non-dogmatic, outcome-oriented attitude. If you have a general interest for the abramelin operation and are after a good read, or if you are looking for the book that finally makes it sound feasible, explains how, and spurs you to seriously invest your time to DO IT, 21st Centruy Mage definitely has its place on your bookshelf
1	1	I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK
4	4	The perfrect book for a person jonesing for the complete culutral history of the jock. Well researched and well structured, the book is a comprehisive guide to everything penis. Don't let whimsical chapter titles like "The Demon Rod," "The Gear Shift," and "The Puncture-proof Balloon" fool you; this is a work of great socio-political importance. As man has evolved, so has his relationship with his organ, and to understand him, you must understand his member. David M. Friedman has given you the map towards total penile nirvana
0	0	The first line in the book talks about rain as a torrential torrent. It gets worse. But who am I to say? I quit on page 39, shortly after the black belt 72 year aunt old scares the traumatized dog into the bath by putting on a ninja mask and jumping into the kitchen screeching, "Eyowwww." Beyond awful
3	3	... the basic plot's the work of a genius. Roland and his Tet are carriors of the task to save a "Calla" village from an attack of so - called wolves. The task is fulfilled perfectly, so the newly grown Tet's about to move on which they'd love to do - BUT... As I said above, the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically, if the author would only have kept it a LITTLE shorter. E.G. the new Tet member's self - told biography shows some details which don't really wanna fit into the actual Tower story at all; all they show is how the guy came into this world, still Midworld, of course. Most of the rest, however, is told fantastically, as I said above. When Eddie comes to talk to Calvin Tower about the house ground with the Rose on it ("Waste Lands" readers will know what I mean) or Susannah's mind is caught by another person, differently said: Detta and Odetta receive company, those facts are told GREAT!!
3	3	This book compiles about 23 issues of spidey's earlier adventures, going through many important chapters. It doesn't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes, perhaps because most Spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume. If you're new to spidey, snag this... if you're not new, still get it to fill in your blanks =)
0	0	I am disappointed and I haven't even read it yet. If anything Steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind. Please read his review and decide for yourself. I still plan to buy the book but as with everything else I will take it with a huge chunk of salt. Sounds to me like the so called "Conservatives" have just put out another book to "unbiasedly" support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses. There is no such thing as a conservative any more. If you want to get back to constitutional government, go check out the Libertarian party and view their positions. They come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people, by the people and for the people. The rest of them are still just self serving and don't want to let go of their power and your money. Dan
4	4	I realize that reviews are wholly based on interpretation and opinion and I respect that. But I don't get people who don't like this book. No offense. That being said (or written, in this case), I loved this book. I found it entertaining, odd and hugely funny and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh. My grandmother wouldn't get this humor, so if you're her, don't buy it. Everyone else--go for it.
4	4	Be prepared to weep at the end but this novel is beautiful. Writing is superb and the characters are not only believable but they stay with you long after you close the book. Anjali is waiting for her husband, Prakash, to pick her up after a trip to her parents. Prakash doesn't show and Anjali faces a life-changing situation as a result. Anjali divorces, remarries and has a son, Amar. The story weaves their fragile lives with a past that comes into the present. Chapters are short and moving; each brought across by the character's feelings and thoughts. Can't say enough good about this story. Remember your kleenex and get ready for a novel to stay with you
4	4	The subtitle of the book, "The Friendship That Won The Civil War" would imply that there really was a friendship, and indeed it seems the relationship between Grant and Sherman was destined to create a winning duo. That makes it unique, not just because of the resultant Union victory, but it really does stand out as the one relationship among the senior leadership of both sides that was capable of creating the kind of synergism necessary to win the struggle. The only other comparable relationship was Lee and Jackson, which was every bit as successful, but didn't survive the war. There are too many anectdotes in the book to mention, but I can say that I learned a lot more than I had previously gleened from separate biographies. Grant was clearly a victim of disappointing performances by subordinates, Sherman being a glowing exception. And Sherman's armies needed the type of visionary leadership that ultimately unleashed them to win. Yet the contingent nature of the events leading to the monumental victories are pointed out again and again. Such were the nature of promotions and military politics in the day. A fast paced read. The relatively quick descriptions of the battles are much appreciated. If Grant and Sherman seemed like inspiring characters before, Hood's book will convince you that the story of their friendship not only won the war, but had a profound impact on 19th century America well beyond 1865
1	1	The numerous vague flow charts, weak graphics, and conflicting statements did little to promote the learning process. Cites many dated studies and implies causation with little statistical relevance. Similarly, the author's exam questions led to more frustration as many appear to be developed to trick the reader
4	4	This is the sequel to LIQUOR, the first of the Rickey and G-Man mysteries. This one is more fun, and I believe, more finely crafted. There is less of the culinary aspect in this book, and more of the mystery-intrigue-New Orleans corruption "stuff', that makes these plots fun. Rickey is his usual impulsive and volatile self, and G-Man, ever steady and calming, evolves into a more complex and active character. Lenny is there, but he does not occupy too much of the book. There are a few surprising "twists" in the plot, and if you are an astute reader, you will "pick-up" the clues. If not, and that is VERY OK, you will find the resolution to the story line fascinating, and quite frankly, plausible. I'm looking forward to the "3rd" in the series, if there is to be one
4	4	I absolutely love Paula and this is the first cookbook of hers that I've bought. The book has a great layout (cakes, pies, cookies, bars, etc.) There are a few pictures (they are not on the same pages as their recipes) that make me want to bake even more! Everything in the book sounds so delicious but the thing that really got me was her pound cake. Now she has about 5 or 6 pound cake variations - I tried the cream cheese variation. Over the past 6 months I have been searching for "the" pound cake recipe and have tried a ton of different ones always with disappointment. When I tried Paula's I kept my expectations low and I was blown away!! It actually tasted like pound cake, not too sweet, not to floury--just perfect!!! I can't wait to try the rest of her recipes, for each ten I looked at I would deffinitely try at least 8 and consider the other 2! A minor disappointment is that some of her recipes call for pre-made cake mixes. Although it is great for cutting down on time I suppose, I don't see the sense in putting pre-made mixes into a cookbook. Still doesn't take away from the flavor or temptation of her desserts. Excellence
1	1	I bought this book on the recommendation of several people that I know pretty well, unfortunately, this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author. In fact, the book should be called "How confederates saved America" as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as Lee, Johnson and Forrest, rather than on Lincoln's instructions to Grant and Sherman and generous terms known as the River Queen Doctrine, "I want no one punished; treat them liberally all around. We want those people to return to their allegieance to the United States and submit to the laws". His errors are numerous. He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution. He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well. Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement. Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics. He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse. Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks. At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic. Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion. Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans. None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla. The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts. He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates. He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said "Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being "simply waste and destruction"". He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact "the devil" as the neo-cons believe he is. Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said. From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states "I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction." Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States. If you are a confederate "lost causer" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book. William Hal
4	4	Both Guyton texts I received were manufactured defectively, coming unglued along the strap of the spine. Poor job, Saunders. Typical. Vander's Human Physiology is an excellent textbook in the sense that it answers all of the right questions at the right time, while you are studying. Also, more chemistry in Vander's, and in the long run that was important to me, since the atom is the basis of everything. Beautiful illustrations and photographs, and again, when compared to Guyton (where the illustrations were cheap and even shameful ... made by a high school art student?) the professional presentation and pedagogical context of Dr. Eric Widmaier's text was much better than the "Old" standard. Depth of coverage in some areas might be slightly less, but still the learning is there for the taking. I love this textbook, and I am convinced students studying from it will fair as highly on board examinations as those trying to learn from any other standard text in the field of introductory physiology.
0	0	Why of course the Chinese government was entirely to blame for the opium imported by the Scotsmen Jardine and Matheson! It just like when Americans have a cocaine problem, it is the US government, and not the drug smugglers and dealers, that has the responsibility. And if the Chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic, well, it's for their own good you know. At least that's Herman's view. Also, the Scots who thus created Hong Kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves. Yes, they did make a little money but that's not why they were in China. They imported opium in order to create Hong Kong so that one day it will become a "premier" commercial city of the Orient, with the ultimate goal of teaching China western financial and economic techniques. If it were not for Jardine and Matheson, how could China have become a great power today, or a candidate superpower tomorrow? No, these two far-sighted Scots had this noble, lofty goal in mind when they came to China, nothing lesss. When historians condemn these two for their "crime" (drug-dealing, that is) they forget that they are actually heroes, as Herman sees so clearly and correctly. And so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the Scots don't even have a country they can call their own while the "barbaric" and "decadent" Chinese do
1	1	"A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean." This is a book I have some trouble with. It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy. But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them. Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness
0	0	Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic
4	4	First issued in 1975, this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of Chicago's architecture that has been destroyed (by nature and man). Today Chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel (and it is, I live there!) but after reading this book you won't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the Urban Renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened. If you are interested in architecture, Chicago history or urban design and planning, read this book

3	3	This is a thoughtful and well researched book. It answers some of the questions which bother most Indians are we aryans or dravidians, how did the indus valley civilization dissappear . The manner in which they explain the myths like the one about the vijayanagar empire tells us about the research put in by the authors. I would recommend this book to novices as well as connosieurs of Indian histor
4	4	This book, which is basically the memoirs of a young German soldier fighting in Russia during WWII, was tragic but fascinating. The language that young Willy Reese is beautiful and gripping. The young man who wrote this, in other words, was a prolific writer. He used captivating language and an unbridled vocabulary. His metaphors and allusions where breath taking and you never got bored from the raw detail that he used to describe the horrors of war. And with this book you also gain an unparalleled account of the horror and wickedness of fighting in the Eastern Front. I would recommend this book if you like WWII history or if you like to read a pseudo-prose poem and memoir with outstanding and fantastic language
0	0	This book is incredible! This author "poo-poos" any idea of Conspiracy as if it's in our deep inner mind. Just notice he equates it with "Paranoid". Does he think Bin Laden and his gang "conspired"? Well if you read one of Mr. Pipes other books, he certainly believes that, so I guess we can say he's paranoid. Conspiracies most likely are natural and normal, an abscence of conspiracy would be contrary to how individuals, nations and institutions work. Mr. Pipes ought to know that well. He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization which was founded by J.P. Morgan and has ties to the Federal Reserve Bank, which is a private bank: not Federal but a cabal of private bankers serving their own best interests. You can't join the CFR on your own--you must be invited! It's a club of the elite, by the elite for the elite. Every high ranking member of the Bush Admin is CFR: Hayden, Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Powell, Paulson, Snow, etc, etc, also so is Ms. Clinton and many other ruling Democrats. Is this a coincidence, hardly! Compare Mr. Pipes book to Tim Carney's "The Big Ripoff", recently hosted on CSPAN book reviews and available on Amzaon. Tim gets close to the target by seeing the symptoms. Mr. Pipes writing of this book is highly suspect. One has to question his motives. It's like the Big Bad Wolf writing a book: How to Raise Chickens in a Hen House and Keep Them Safe. You would be better reading G. Edward Griffin's book: Creature from Jekyll Island-a second look at the Federal Reserve.

I read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library. After reading the other reviews I am glad I didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending.
4	4	I'm updating my review, because I think the first draft was skimpy, and I feel like I have a better view of this book now that more time has passed since my first reading. The crux of the book is Guskin's concept of "taking it off the page." This was extremely valuable to me, and it turned cold readings from being scary to being my favorite part of the acting process! "Taking it off the page" is applicable to rehearsals, too, though, and to freshening up ongoing performances. The book lightly touches on a lot of different types of acting: Auditions, Rehearsals, Sit-Coms, Serials, Small Roles, Big Roles, Touring, Film Acting. I think Guskin wants to explain briefly what you need to do differently for each of these situations. The book is too short to teach all details for any of these, though, so you will need other sources. The book is very important to me, and my first experience with it was that I read it, and my very next rehearsal was the best rehearsal I had ever had. I felt so free, it was amazing. That is his main objective, to free you up to enjoy and explore.

0	0	I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily.
1	1	This book, published originally in three installments, is regarded as a turning point in graphic fiction, like DARK KNIGHT and WATCHMEN, but I just don't see it. Generally speaking, I like Gaiman's story lines, but this time it's all just confusing. The title character, a crime fighter superhero trying to infiltrate a mob, is killed in the first few pages -- but there's more of her back in the greenhouse so all is not lost. Or something. A newly hatched flower-woman, who seems to share some of the dead one's memories, sets out to uncover her identity. I think. The mob is run by Lex Luthor (why?), who wants to capture her and/or her little sister (or whatever) for dissection. But Carl, just out of prison, who used to work for Luthor and who previously murdered his wife, upon whom the orchids were based, can't get his job back and wants to get even with everyone. This guy is a loser and screw-up -- but suddenly, in the last installment, the action having relocated to the Amazon Basin, he becomes a very talented and successful jungle killer. (How?) Other people from the back-story weave in and out of the plot, including one who became the Swamp Thing, but none of what they say or do makes much sense. And why does Batman get a cameo? (Not to mentioned assorted bad guys from Gotham?) McKean's artwork is interesting for its own sake, owing more to oil painting than the usual sort of airbrush work, but all in all, I have to give this a shrug
0	0	When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along. This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice. Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book. It is self-indulgent and inane. If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it. I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful
4	4	From the remarkable book structuring (the "chapters" are organized in alphabetical order) to the intriguingly insightful commentary, Seth Godin has once again created a work of excellence. The book is an easy read, but at the same time leaves the mind reeling with thoughts of "Oh my, I need to fix that, or do that, or change that." I found the chapter on "Clean Fire Trucks" particularly interesting, as I had just 2 months earlier finished an innovation article on "Retiring the Fire Trucks" -- which deals with the same concept of preventing fires and not letting them start in the first place! (As such, you can then have time to clean the fire trucks, or as I put it, to retire them altogether!). His rants are compelling yet at the same time hilarious (hilarious in the sense of all the silly things we do as a people that we really shouldn't be doing). Take for example his rant on "Wrappers" and how the method of packaging both the tangible and intangible create an aura around the product that determines how the product is perceived, received, and applied. One might say, "It's the WRAPPER, stupid." Once again, Mr. Godin has helped to "validate my existence" (despite my intense self-certainty!) by showing that the crazy, "outside the box" (hey, can we just shred the box, then burn it in effigy of the outdated strategies and the consultants who promote them?), simplifying, forward-looking, remarkable, visionary adventures we can lead our clients and companies on are really worth the effort. In short, less is more, small is big, and remarkable is just that: REMARKABLE. This book is REMARKABLE. I strongly encourage adding it to your shelf, then spreading the virus of its contents to others. P.S. The entire ending "Bonus Section" on blogs and other resources is something not to be missed, and single-handedly justifies the purchase

4	4	Satirical. Sarcastic. Ironic. Humorous. Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life. This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life. The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield. He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home. In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life. One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps. As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him. Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness. But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad. Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends. When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything. Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all. As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets
4	4	One of the most wonderful things about Rabbi Kushner's writings is that he isn't afraid to tackle the hard questions. If we indeed have a Shepherd, why isn't He doing a better job? To this question, Kushner says, "the psalmist would teach us to see the world, without illusions that nothing bad will ever happen, but without the fear that we will be utterly destroy This is a lovely book full of hope and wisdom. Drawing on the individual lines of the Twenty-Third Psalm, Rabbi Kushner (known best for his book Why Bad Things Happen to Good People) creates 15 essays that are thought-provoking and inspiring. He outlines the historical background of the words of the psalm, noting "The earliest ancestors of the Hebrew People who gave us the Bible were nomads, owning no property, bound to no one location but traveling with their flocks and herds wherever there was pastureland for the animals to graze on." The analogy of God to a shepherd makes perfect sense in that environment. The beauty of the analogy is that it still speaks to us today. The image which is evoked is one of caring and greater knowledge. ed by the things that do happen." Kushner is skilled at relating Biblical literature to questions and concerns of today. He relates the verse to terrorists, Einstein and daily living. He provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively. His words also provide hope to all of us: "You may have to work hard to earn your living...But you don't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself. All you have to do is stop striving, relax, and say to yourself, I feel good about who I am." This slim volume will stay in a handy place in my home for years to come. It's a book I will come back to again and again for wisdom, courage and peace
0	0	F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life
1	1	This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives. A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband? It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research. That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book. I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it. It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure
4	4	Economist Joseph A. Schumpeter's keen intellect makes some of today's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows. Some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century. Only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while Marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse, he was probably correct that it eventually would. Schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies, news he feels society should greet with angst. He believed that capitalism's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat, but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control. Fully understanding this complex, although non-mathematical, treatise may require some background; it is not a book for the novice. While this 1942 classic may seem dated in spots, those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism's grave should consider that Schumpeter expected socialism's dominance to take a century or more. We recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic, economic case for the rise of socialism
0	0	I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom. The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy? This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it. I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published!
0	0	The book's case studies, code and build files assume that J2EE 1.4 comes with the PointBase database server. J2EE 1.4 currently only comes bundled with the Derby database server. As a result, the book is useless. Emails to the publisher failed to resolve the problem
0	0	Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil &quot;Red Man&quot; She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended
3	3	This is a great book, I found it full of excellent ideas on how to judge the appropriate pot and hand odds. Would have gotten a five star but is somewhat complex ar times

3	3	Written in 1948, this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime Brits in a poor backwater in West Africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality. Foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both Henry Scobie, the honest policeman of this coastal town, and his "literary" wife, Louise, who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local British "club" members who constantly mind one another's business. Scobie no longer loves his wife but can't bring himself to hurting her. He simply pities her. And Louise no longer loves Henry and wants desperately to escape from West Africa, especially when she finds out that her "Ticki" has been passed up for promotion to Commissioner. The atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man, Wilson, appears on the scene and, in his youthful stupidity, falls in love with Louise while he conducts secret investigations on British authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through Africa to Germany. Scobie is one of those suspects. A marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt Syrian merchant, Yusef, is thrown into the mix. I can see Sidney Greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation. Add jealousy, desperation, a contrast of honesty and lies, sex, and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains. O yes, and then, as always, there's the brilliant writing of Graham Greene, his wonderful metaphors, crystal clear descriptions, and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters. All this equals a modern classic. My only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding Catholicism, a religion I cannot stomach anymore, and my personal disbelief that someone like Scobie can take Catholicism so seriously. But this is my own thing. Greene remains brilliant, original, and indeed, "the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety," or at least one of the top five
0	0	The newer editions of the Delorme Atlases are much inferior to, and skimpier on data, than their older editions. I assume they did this to save on printing costs. The maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had. For example,in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks, few of which are even named, and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included. Other than the newly added GPS coordiante data, they are just glorified road maps, which you can get at the gas station. I own several of these from many years back, but am very disappointed in the new editions
1	1	I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it??? Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good.
4	4	Equipped with a keen intuition, great confidence, and credentials stacked sky high, Kate Solisti - Mattelon steps up and ably swats one home for the dog lover in us all. She has long understood that dogs run the wide and crooked. It's we humans who took the broad view and tried to fit it into the straight and narrow scope of understanding. An awkward fit at best, if not totally improbable. She presents her material simply, in a parable format of sorts to help us understand the heart and mind of man's best friend. Repeated readings pay off. Myself, having to resolve grief issues on having to put my thirteen years old Siberian Husky, Riva to sleep this past summer. I now know without doubt that my favorite life companion is a part of me forever. This book can and should be a part of you. Highly enjoyable. Highly recommended
4	4	My son is 8 and although he is a great reader (has read all of the Harry Potter series more than once), he wanted me to read this one to him. I have to say we both enjoyed it equally. I would agree to a chapter or two every other night or so, but found myself agreeing to "just one more chapter" on a regular basis. It was nice to find something we both liked and looked forward to. What an imaginative tale. Now I need to get the rest of the series..
4	4	I assign this book to students in my psychology seminar. These students at a women's college tell me that they find Women and Desire to be thought provoking, interesting, even helpful. I noticed a column in Newsweek by Anna Quindlen in October. She argued that women today still need the F word feminism because society hasn't changed as much as we like to tell ourselves. It appears that the need for books such as this one by Polly Young-Eisendrath continues to be valid
4	4	Following a worldwide plague, Robert Neville may be the only man left alive. His family is dead. All the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out, attack him, and drink his blood. Holed up in his home, which he has converted into a safe house, Robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status, the constant need to seek shelter, food and protection, and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague. A combination of science fiction and horror, I Am Legend is an atmospheric, stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept: the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire. The book is short and difficult to put down, well paced, both intelligent and frightening, and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres. I highly recommend it, and I consider it one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. This read through of I Am Legend was my first time coming back to it since I read it in high school (now almost four years ago). The story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years--or, more precisely, the science of Matheson's conception of vampires. Coming back to the text, it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly. For the most part, this narrative is a method of conveying Matheson's sci-fi concepts--perhaps like any true SF author, he puts scientific concept ahead of character, and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story's scientific concept has on them. In the case of I Am Legend, that concept is a scientific and (mostly) logical explanation for vampires. And it's a wonderful, brilliant concept, more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years. I still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail, making the end of the book feel a little too fast--nonetheless, the concept is a great one, and very interesting to read about. The flips side of that situation, however, is that the book lacks characterization and emotion. Those aspects aren't entirely absent by any means. Robert, the protagonist, has a back story, goes through emotional phases, and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in. He's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable. Nonetheless, these personal characteristics and even his interactions, past and present, exist primarily to move towards, expound on, and explain Matheson's scientific point, his conception of the vampires. In some cases, this is obvious: Richard's memories serve to build his character, but they also serve to lead him, and thus the reader, to a better understanding of the vampires. At a mere 160 pages, Matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character--not so that it overwhelmed his SF ideas, but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book. The lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result. Despite these thoughts and critiques, I greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it. Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in I Am Legend, one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown. His SF concepts are detailed, intelligent, and truly absorbing. The book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that I have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read. I highly recommend the text, and it's a good one to own--although short and easily readable, it's wonderful to come back to and reread. It also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/Halloween text. I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those
0	0	There's nothing in this book that isn't in many other photography books. Much of the book is taken up with definitions and discussion of equipment and techniques, rather than approaches to creativity (as is implied by the sub-title of the book). The photos are far from inspiring. I didn't learn anything from this book
4	4	Jolly Captain Jack Aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian Doctor Maturin Return for this 7th book in the renowned Aubrey/Maturin series. In this segment, Maturin and fem fatale Diana Viller's romance heats up, Jack's money troubles become more pronounced, and Doc Maturin's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him. What can I say about this great series? The character of Jack Aubrey is just SO endearing and Doctor Maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor, that this series simply cannot be missed! Even the presence of Diana Villers (a character I've simply loathed for quite some time), seems less irritating. I'm listening to the unabridged Narrated version by Patrick Tull, and this series is wonderful. Cannot be missed. Particularly love the parts where Jack/Maturin and The Swedish Envoy are in prison. Too funny! Wonderful series. I highly recommend it.
4	4	Highly recommended for personal insights. Densely packed with information clarifying difficult concepts. This book will give you some clear insights into things you may not have received along the way and how to get past those. Although it is thin, the book has an incredibly large amount of information in it. This is the kind of book you will read the first time with an expression of "Wow" on your face. It will then be something that you will be drawn back to read again and again. Even if you don't feel you "missed anything" along the way, the books insights and examples will provide great insights to you. It will provide great understanding of the self and others, therefore anyone can benefit from reading it. If you liked Fromm's The Art Of Loving you will love this book as well. The premise of this book being, we are all gifted and it is up to us to reclaim that understanding. EXCELLENT self-help material
4	4	I just reread it recently as an adult. I had this boxed set of three hardcover E.B. White books when I was a kid - Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan (which I remember as my favorite of the three, though I hardly remember it today), and Stuart Little. I was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything. Anyway, coming back to it as an adult (or sort of adult) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out, the tone, the story, the dark deep themes - as a short novel, it stands with the best of literature. I know there's no such thing as a "perfect" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists. It's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint Americana. Certainly not only for children. A fine novel by any standards
4	4	If you want the opposite of James Frey--that is, if you want to read beautiful, true prose that doesn't flinch from the deeper truths, read Caldwell. This is a book about West Texas, growing up, leaving home, struggling with family, remembering the farm, hating Vietnam, going to Mexico, reading great books, moving forward. I put a pot of coffee on and read through the night, then passed it on to my Dad, who did the same. Thanks, Ms. Caldwell.

0	0	This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work "Purple Cane Road" read by Will Patton.
1	1	The best part about this book was the intro. In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction. The rest of the book is a chore to read. The confusing and tedious writing style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make. Someone should have counseled Mr. Bloom that "Brevity is the soul of wit."
4	4	I hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior. Perhaps this was true in previous bindings, but the copy I recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come. I'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards, though as a beginner I have not put it to lots of use. Basically I use the New Nelson, with this dictionary as a supplement, especially for compounds. And there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system.

3	3	A good read. Hurston does an excellent job of depicting the parallel experiences of the captivity of the Israelites and the American Slave. In fact, one could argue that the experience of the Israelites is the American Slave experience. This is a great book for high school reading, it provides a variety of cause and effect themes that all young adults need to know; among them, if you oppress a people or person you breed fear, insecurity, and eventual self hatred in that human. I highly recommend Their Eyes Were Watching God another of Hurston's literary jewels. jewels

If you like the history of how a great race car was born and how three special guy's, Wilbur Shaw, Ted Horn and Cotton Henning made the Masarati 8CTF a legend, get this book! This car was a winner in 1939-40, should have won in 1941, and finished no worse than 4th from 1946 to 1948. It was still competing in the 500 until 1951
1	1	George has always been my favorite Beatle. I have been celebrating his birthday and got the Concert for george Harrison and watched it on his deathdate, and even wrote my 6th grade biography on him. So, I turned to this book. There were plenty of grammatical errors and false information. I think that it said in the front that he didn't "hassle any of the beatles for this information" then how could he even get information such as this. Go to I, Me, Mine it's a better book because its WRITTEN BY HARRISON HIMSELF!

1	1	First, FIX THE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION AMAZON!!!!! In spite of Loopy's warning I ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory. Wrong! I received the same 1995 book and when I complained to Amazon they sent me a replacement. Another 1995 book. While the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. The Clark Fork, for example, is described as "teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin." My online research has indicated the Clark Fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide I would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip. If this book were up to date I would give it at least 4 stars. But considering the age I would recommend you pass and search for other sources

But, this book revels how woman across America knitted items in support of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, WWI and WWI. In fact, there is currently a program to knit scarves in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Knitting for charity is also discussed. When our governments can not, or will not, provide for the needy; American's women have
0	0	I generally don't enjoy reading books with teenaged legs and sunflowers on the cover. I often read on the subway, and it can be a bit embarassing. If I chose to weather the pornographic implications of such cover art, I expect to be rewarded for my sacrifice--with, say--A GOOD BOOK. I'd even settle for full characters who change and grow. I'd settle for dialogue that occasionally rose above tediousness and pointlessness--perhaps dialogue that, in fact, advanced the plot or advanced character development. If I am going to sit on the L train with a book that slightly resembles a Baby-Sitters Club Epic, I would like for that book to be enriching/rewarding/entertaining/redeeming. Why is this book 400 pages long??!!!! Nothing happens. The family has the same conversations over and over again, and nothing ever changes, and the father character is so irresponsibly designed that his dialogue is virtually identical to that of her 31-year-old boyfriend, Oliver. No one comes alive, except maybe the mother. I found almost nothing to hold on to in the entire novel. The opening line was intriguing. From there on out, it becomes progressively worse. I felt only for one person: the mother. Because she sat in the background, hands folded meekly, kind of depressed and annoyed, for the entire book. Which was a lot like how RR made me feel, too
4	4	In Women &amp; Christianity, educator and author Mary Malone examines the chronic and pervasive ambivalence towards women throughout the first thousand years of Christianity. While women from the very beginnings of the Christian Church have been graced, called, inspired, and canonized down through the centuries, they have also been excluded and even oppressed by clergy and other leaders of the Christian community who cited scripture and Christian tradition (including Apocryphal and Gnostic literatures) as the justifying source of their discrimination. Very highly recommended for women's studies and students of Christian history from 30 C.E. to 1002 C.E. (the &quot;Dateline&quot; section is particularly noteworthy), Women &amp; Christianity showcases both the persistent courage and the innovative quality of women's lives, as well as offering a critical analysis of previous conventional histories. The clear emphasis throughout is the enduring importance of women's contributions to the creation of Western culture in general, and the evolving Christian community in particular
4	4	I am loving this book, but let's get one thing straight. This is not a cupcake book, as the cover would lead you to believe. In fact, I only saw one reference to a cupcake from a regular layer cake recipe, even though it is written by one of the owners of New York's famed Magnolia Bakery, which has gained notoriety for its cupcakes. At any rate, the recipes contained in this book are pure magic. So far I have made the white layer cake with chocolate chips and peanut butter icing (as suggested), and it was quite a hit with friends and family. Other recipes I'm going to try in the next few days are the sour cream coffee cake and the buttercup golden layer cake. This book is all about making things from scratch like they did in the olden days, but you could also mix and match homemade cakes with store-bought icing or vice-versa. Read the introductory section with tips and pay attention to the details (e.g., use cake flour instead of all-purpose or self-rising, use butter/sour cream at room temp., etc.), which will make all the difference. The section with icing recipes is short but covers a variety of flavors. It's definitely not an Atkins-friendly cookbook or any of that, so you know it's good for your sweet tooth! I would definitely recommend this book to any baker, novice or expert, and am looking forward to buying 'The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook' (co-authored by Appel) next
1	1	This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it
4	4	Rashid Khalidi is the Edward Said Chair in Arab Studies at Columbia University: his Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints And America's Perilous Path In The Middle East blends history, current events and social issues in a penetrating examination of America's growing involvement in Middle East affairs. Chapters document the history of such involvements and the likely outcome of the latest, drawing on the author's vast political knowledge to paint a more damning picture than most. A 'must' for any serious about Middle East affairs.
1	1	I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers. But this story is just way too slow. Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again. I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner. About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading. I just couldn't get into the characters. I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.
3	3	Mr. Galvan's writing about a piece of property, at first, seems strange; however, as you read you become absorbed. He writes of much more than the land, he writes of the people who live that land. It takes a special person to live in the wilds of Wyoming, and an extrodinary person to live in the isolated, rugged, raw, and unforgiving areas. This is a book I have given as a gift to many individuals who know what it is truly like to live here in Wyoming, want to live here, or seem to possess that independence and creativity needed to live here
4	4	This book is not only an interesting read, but fun as well! The pictures detail everything from each step of refurbishing a sailboat, including what tools to use and how to use them. I just ordered 3 more copies and can't wait to give them to my boating enthusiastic friends! Whether your re-doing a sailboat or not, I would highly recommend this to anybody who's into boating.
1	1	back and forth and back and forth. im happy. im sad. happy. sad. love him. dont love him. love him. dont blah. blah blah. we're poor. we're not poor. we're poor. a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas. malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive). spoiler he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok! (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no. when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad. in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)
0	0	To prove America is a Christian nation David Barton cites the little known blasphemy conviction of Abner Kneeland. During the 1830s Kneeland,a former Universalist turned pantheist, was sentenced to sixty days in a Boston jail for ridiculing the deity of Christ. Barton cites Commonwealth v. Abner Kneeland as example of how early American jurisprudence defended Christianity. Either David Barton is a sloppy scholar or he is a man with a scary agenda. Does Barton believe that state governments should have the power to jail people for stating religious opinions contrary to his? Why else would he cite the Kneeland case? Kneeland should only be a curious anachronism, not a legal precedent.

Spence has the ability to take complex concepts and translate them so that practitioners can make sense of the research and best practices. This is a &quot;must read&quot; for teachers striving to increase academic achievemnet for all students
3	3	Doug Montgomery got excellent statistical training at VPI. He also has a wealth of practical experience from his consulting work. His books on regression, statistical design and response surfaces are all well written and understandable to engineers. This 4th edition published in 1997 still contains all the useful information on factorial and fractional factorial designs. Chapter 14 is a wonderful up-to-date chapter that covers important process optimization topics not often covered in traditional design of experiments books. This includes response surface methods, mixture experiments, evolutionary operation and Taguchi methods. It does not require high level mathematics
4	4	This is a great journey into Narnia. I enjoyed every book and every chapter. I know everyone I talked to has read this book as a child, I think they need to re-read as an adult and really dig deeper into each chapter.
4	4	Way better than most art books, Covers so many necessary points. The author has a great website too
4	4	This book has fascinating events happening all the time. I couldn't even blink one second away from it. Even though this book was used for a project, it was far more for me than homework... This book really teaches true lessons that all of us, young the elders need to learn. Especially from Johnny Raven's point of view. The story plot was fascinating... how many times did i use that word..? Well it is truly is...
0	0	I have enjoyed reading other books by Mr. Prosek, however, this one was a true disappointment. I couldn't figure out if this was a book about fishing or drinking. There seemed to be more anecdotes regarding drinking and getting soused than any fishing action. Even if the author loves to drink, the book is supposed to be about fishing the 41st parallel and all that that should entail. I may not have learned much about trout fishing, but I sure know where to find booze joints along the 41st parallel
0	0	My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., &quot;People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them.&quot; That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money. Fo
1	1	Don't read this book. I wish I hadn't. It ruined Pete Rose in my eyes, not because of what others have said about him, but because of what Rose said about himself. My grandpa was a huge fan of Pete Rose and once took me to meet him at Riverfront Stadium when I was around six. About the only thing I'm glad for with this book is it didn't come out in my grandpa's lifetime. We all make mistakes. We're only human and that's what humans do: we screw up. Sometimes badly. I wish Pete Rose was in the Hall of Fame. I wish he was coaching the Reds today. I wish most of all he'd never placed a single bet on baseball. But as for Pete, like I said up there, he still doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will. This book was a disappointment for many reasons. It did give me a nice look at Pete's career with the Cincinati Reds and took me back to my grandfather's tales of how great the Big Red Machine of the 1970's was, but what was lacking in these 322 pages was contrition, and I think that was supposed to be what this book was about. The Pete Rose I met in My Prison Without Bars, was a likable fellow, but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative, "this is somebody else's fault" attitude that put me off and I'm sure put a lot of others off, too. Rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the 1980's, a fact that surprised virtually no one, but instead of presenting an apology, or even a straightforward confession, Rose comes across as a bitter man, still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing. He blames everyone from his friends and business associates, to Major League baseball (for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players). Rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa, Charlie Hustle, the greatest baseball player of his era, left me feeling negative toward him, and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook. Those were not images I had of the man before I started this book and I'm sorry that's how I felt when I was done. If I could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work, I'd tell him: Pete, you've led an interesting sixty-plus years. You're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field. You deserve to be in Cooperstown. But your attempt to make amends with this book---probably your last chance, sadly--is a dismal failure and a backset. I remember well the night you passed Ty Cobb's all-time hitting record. I read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom I heard so much growing up. I now wish I didn't know 4/5ths of what I now do know about you. As I said starting out: don't read this book
4	4	`Notes From The Underground' is a formidable work of philosophy and of psychology, not to mention its worth as a novel. In the space of around one hundred pages, Dostoyevsky manages to expound theories on reason, alienation, suffering, and human inaction. The book's importance and influence on generations of writers cannot be over-emphasised; Sartre and Camus are only two examples of people who have been directly influenced by this book. The book is presented in two parts. Part one `Underground' is written in the form of the nameless narrator's rambling thoughts on reason and his claim that throughout history, human actions have been anything but influenced by reason. Underground Man's charge is that man values most the freedom to choose to act in opposition to reason's dictates. Dostoyevsky's critique of reason then, although it demands attention and is somewhat difficult to follow, sets the philosophical foundations for the rest of the book. Part two `A Propos of the Wet Snow' is much easier to read, as the narrator recounts three episodes which happened when he was fifteen years younger and working as a civil servant in St. Petersburg. The first considers an incident in which an army officer insults him and goes on to detail Underground Man's subsequent internal anguish at his inability to commit an act of retribution. The second episode takes place at a farewell dinner for an acquaintance named Zverkov. The narrator is utterly disgusted with the company in which he finds himself but despite this, he is unable - even though he desires it - to make them realise this. The third episode details Underground Man's brief, painful and emotional relationship with a prostitute. Dostoyevsky is refreshing in this book thanks not only to his incredibly powerful prose, but also for the intense but subtle way in which the stories reflect and indeed embody his philosophical theories. This dark and pessimistic portrayal of the nature of man may not sit very comfortably with many readers, however the ideas expressed in `Notes From The Underground' are as relevant and worthy of deliberation now as I am sure they were in 1864.
0	0	Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked
1	1	As a huge fan of Jim Henson, the Muppets, and Kermit the Frog I was hugely disappointed. The recaps of Jim Henson's life and Kermit's were interesting, but the rest was trite nonsense
3	3	Reader beware - 800 plus pages, so this is no book for story time. Extremely prolific, James A. Michener writes as only he can write about the Caribbean, that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by Cuba, Puerto Rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape. This is a powerful history of these islands, and James Michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of Arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to Castro's Cuba. This is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from, as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel. You will learn more from this book about the Caribbean Sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you, and you will have more fun doing it! I gave it four stars simply because with a book this size, there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts, and there were. If it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a Pulitzer
3	3	In school my class and I read the book the Wish Giver. This book is about three kids who each receive a magic card from a small, chubby, mysterious little man named Thaddeus Blinn. When each child makes a wish , the wish turns out the wrong way. The moral of the story is "Be Careful what you wish for". This was a very interesting book. I really enjoyed it. Bill Brittain was a wonderful author. I highly reccomend this book.
4	4	her abilities affect her, then this diary will interest you. Ms. Choquette comes across as a charming, friendly person whom one would love to have over for dinner. She writes about her parents (especially her mother) and how her large family was close and sort of quirky. She describes her early psychic experiences and her training with two teachers who open her abilities up even more and teach her about life. The most enjoyable part of the book for me was the descriptions Sonia gave of clients, mostly from the 70s -- lime green hot pants, bouffant hairdos, tie-dyed t-shirts and platform shoes...those were the days...how did anyone get a date back then? The only criticism I have about the book is that Ms. Choquette mentions several times that her family was Catholic and religiously so. I do not doubt her family's religious sensbilities, but the Church teaches against almost everything that Sonia practices and believes -- reincarnation, clairvoyance, ascended masters, divination with tarot cards, spirit guides, etc. I don't think it is possible to be a Catholic in the sense of someone who believes in the dogmas of the Church and be a New Ager as Sonia is. She also says that she prayed the rosary before her readings and one of her teachers said that she would attract only good spirits that way, but she also needed to pray the Our Father. The rosary requires the recitation of the Our Father at least 6 times, so I was confused when Sonia said she then began to pray the Our Father as well. I wonder what rosary she was praying.
0	0	This book doesn`t compare very well with any other recipe books you will have seen - there are no pictures of the finished dishes for a start. A lot of the "celebrities" you won`t have heard of - that shouldn`t matter if the recipes are good. Its a very American book and doesn`t travel well; the quantities are measured in "cups", oven temps quoted in Fahrenheit only and products not available anywhere else (what are "graham crackers"??) There are lists at the back of bands with food names and songs with food names (brilliant journalism girls) and the authors thank you pages are hilarious - thanking their cats and themselves for the joy-filled experience of working with each other. I realise a recipe book has to have some simple ones included, but Hot Rod Hot Dogs - buy some hot dog sausages, buy some white buns, add some relish and mustard. Enjoy! Peanutbutter on Toast Sandwiches, buy some peanutbutter, toast some bread. Enjoy! They`re having a laugh, aren`t they? But this book is supporting a charity. It doesn`t actually say how much of the proceeds are going to Freedom From Hunger, just "some".....so I suggest you give your donation directly to the charity instead of buying thi
1	1	Like many people, I bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, Amadeus, and the truth. I am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. The effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which I'm not particularly interested in. It may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. How do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? I'm sure some of Solomon's conclusions are valid but I kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book I had left to go so I could say I finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable
1	1	Back in his day Heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength. This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint. As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age. The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history. To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him. There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on. This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story. Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America. There isn't really a plot. The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal. It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career. This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author.
1	1	I genuinely wanted to like this book. However, the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by Goldhagen's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the Holocaust. It doesn't read like a history book and I wasn't surprised to learn (afterword) that the author is not a historian. That said, there is value in reading it. The book is rich in facts and detail, the result of some indepth research. However, the way the author uses (and abuses) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration. The book is filled with 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove Goldhagen's hypothesis. Millions of non-Jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work, but it still can be worth a read. But, only if you are not put off by reptitive, awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author's emotionally driven interpretations

Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself. I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book
0	0	I had to force myself to finish this book. I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming.
1	1	I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it. I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point. There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance. While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better
3	3	Maybe it is a strange focus for a book of social studies, not just describing how people talk about themselves, but how they talk about each other. In the end, I think this is the most interesting part of the book, what it tells us about the gossip of Shanghai people. As a person who grew up in Shanghai and left eight years ago, I am drawn to all stories of Shanghai out of nostalgia and curiousity for my old home. So I bought this book in the university book store. What I found is an unusual type of story, written by a foreign, well American, man about sex in Shanghai. Some things he writes are so familiar to me I laughed out loud. Others are not what I remember of Shanghai. I like best the stories these people tell about their friends. I remembered some of the stories in my street, and it made me laugh
3	3	There was a time when Stephen King was one of my favorite authors. Then I started hanging out with a better class of authors, hehe. But now, he is once again one of my favorite authors. As I said before, he's raised his game. ON WRITING and everything after. If it's a re-issue of an oldie, well, it has a new introduction by the guy who wrote ON WRITING, and that alone makes it worth buying again. Truly, I love every word he's published for the past five years. The guy was already (perhaps) the best seller of all time, and he wasn't satisfied. How great is that? What we have here is a collection of 14 short stories, some just creepy/scary and others literary. It's a wonderful mix of what we've always known he excels at and what we may not have realized he excels at. Several months back, I heard some scary rumors to the effect that he might retire. That is not allowed. Stephen, if you retire, I'm gonna round up Annie Wilkes and we're gonna make you shave Picasso's neck. So there!
1	1	This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation. If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress &amp; strain book its more poorly written then the Marks
4	4	I just wanted to add another vote of confidence for this marvelous dictionary. I got through 4 years of college Latin with it, and almost never failed to find the word I was looking for. I particularly appreciate the idiomatic expressions highlighted in bold typeface, to make it easy to skim down the definition to find the one you're looking for. Its only downfall is that, as a paperback, it begins to get a bit well-thumbed, leading the serious Latinist to think, a little wistfully, that it would be nice if it came in a hardbound edition. But for a mere six bucks, you can easily afford to buy a replacement. Personally, I own two
4	4	The author of the chapter 1- Robert H.Heusen is sincere at p.2 saying that other local ethnicities were indigeneous to the area where Armenia was established much later-e.g.the Khaldeans,the Urartians etc.;that ancient authors wrote about it clearly.I would add that Strabo in the Ic.wrote in his Geography of the World that the Armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the Iberians/Moskhians; this is in vol 5 of Strabo,the Loeb Classical Library edition in 1936;this is the area where the Republic of Armenia was created in 1918.I recently learned that its name was planned to be 'Republic of Erevan'(not Armenia) and the League of the Nations promised to the government of Kartu i.e. Georgia that the creation of Armenia in Caucasia was a temporary measure-F.Nansen from that League of the Nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the Balkans and that soon the League of the Nations would move the Republic of Armenia and her Armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of Turkey-to the Mediterranean.These facts are known from materials published by F. Nansen available in English and some translated into Russian now on the web.The creation of that republic and that of Azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names:the Iberians,the Moskhians,the Kardi etc. R.Heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before World War I,the Armenians were a minority in what became the Republic of Armenia in 1918.After reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page "a map of the historical Armenia" encompassing greater territory than the Great Britain.R.Heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.The term Armenian Plateau is frequently used by the author.It is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.Moses Khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.It is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called Pseudo-Moses Khorenatsi.I have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications,in unpublished archives of Prof.Mikheil Tamarashvili known as Michele Tamarati in Rome and Paris.Many authors in XIX century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him:among them Mr.Lenormann,Ilia Chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the Mkhitarist congregation in Venice- Western Europe for spreading false information.'Gate of Alans' (p.152)usually has a better term in historical sources:the Gate of Aragvi.Metsamor mentioned at p.49 is the distorted term from Kartu term 'Metsamuli' meaning 'Cherry colour'-as nearby clyffs are reddish with minerals.This Kartu/Kartuli designation was given to those clyffs,the nearby village and the river by ethnic Kartu population millenia ago before aliens-Armenians among them-immigrated to that area-some as refugees,others as invaders accompanying alien armies.Authors of this book mention a huge number of writings of persons- including the ancient Persians,Greeks,Romans,Kartu(Shota Rustaveli,History of Kartly,Dionysius the Areopagite,Georgian Chronicle(p.242);myriad of modern authors and those of XIX-XX cc.The book is clearly addressed to modern young ethnic Armenians and teach them that they are entitled not only to what was made the Republic of Armenia in 1918(itself an abuse of the human rights of another-indigeneous nation that has created a kingdom including the territory of that area in much early days),but to the region'greater than the Great Britain'.Still I give to the authors of this book 'excellent', i.e. 5 stars- for excellent misinformation

0	0	Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book

Evolutionist 2: OK....so...how do we censor these scientists and academics...make sure that noone actually reads these books?

After reading OUR pseudo-review, people will HAVE to continue worshipping Naturalist saints and those yet to come that will prove evolution against all the current evidence! Evolutionist 1: You're right! Instead of actually reading the books, we could could spend hours of our own free time writing these false reviews all over the internet! We're prophets of Darwin, Gould, and Dawkins! Evolutionist 2: Wait...won't the intelligent design people just censor us or try to make US look stupid?

0	0	Books of political position ought be fact ridden. They should move you to the author's point of view, if not the author's conclusions, by marshalling facts first; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts. Only then should we be given some further speculation, unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions. Mr. Horowitz does none. Instead he starves us for facts. He substitutes instead only editorial cant. I can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one. The audience is not the inquiring, the undecided or the doubting. For example, he contrasts, on the first page the Iraq war as "so successful in its results.", with the Vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war. Mr. Horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of American power is a bulwark of national security. He insists that American Presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists. I kept waiting for evidence of any kind. He even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes, yet were more important than Pearl Harbor. My guess is that WW II was not so cheap or unworthy. Neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the World Trade Center; at least I can reference Time magazine as the source. Mr Horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of Democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the Neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of American soldiers and guards. Mr. Horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort. Many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources. He quotes the New York Review of Books, but leaves out words he does not like. Oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the Bush administration "on the run". He probably meant something else, but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general. I cannot even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical

However, experience has taught me that a good guide book is STILL a valuable tool when traveling to Disney, and well worth the money for the knowledge and tips you gain. I've bought _The OFFICIAL Guide to WDW_ (not worth the $ in my opinion), Passporter's (also good), Birnbaum's, etc. but this is still the best-- especially if you are in the planning stages of your trip. If you have small kids, I'd recommend getting the smaller, more portable [...

4	4	This is a very informative book that clears up lots of misconceptions. It explains why the &quot;wellfare state&quot; is still around, even after so many death notices. The analysis shows that there is no net negative cost for comprehensive and universal social programs, and that there are often significant benefits. For those who can read this book without ideological and political blinders, there is much to learn from Peter Lindert's book

4	4	Astronomers detect a large object entering the Solar system from deep space. At first it is thought to be just another large rock, but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called Rama. A team of scientists blast off from Earth to investigate in a ship called the Endeavor. What follows is a story of exploration, and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written. Who built Rama? What is it's purpose? Why did it come to our solar system? The story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship. Each new discovery brings new surprises as well. This is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on Earth have very different ideas about what Rama is, what is represents, and what should be done. This book is, in my opinion, one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written. First published in 1973, it remains as fresh as if it were written today. There are several things that I really like about this novel. First, the exploration of Rama by the crew of the Endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman. Discoveries are assimilated, risks are weighed, and the plan evolves. One common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi (particularly when transfered to TV) is that individuals of superhuman stature (e.g. the main character has a Ph.D. in astrophysics, was in the Special Forces, a fighter pilot, and in their spare time a classically trained French chef, a lyric poet, and fluent in ten languages) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death. This may add drama to the plot, but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic. The characters, while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity, are not absurdly talented beyond reason. Second, Rama itself is fascinating. Clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore. Finally, there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of Rama that many have tried to duplicate, but none have even come remotely close to succeeding. This book has `atmosphere'. Early in the novel Clarke analogizes the exploration of Rama with the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb. There is something wonderful and mysterious about Rama that goes far beyond current human understanding, but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection. It is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than 2001. In the latter novel, the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible. In Rama, the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens. If I had any complaint at all, the novel is a bit short by modern standards. It really seems light at about 240 pages, and it would have been nice if Clarke had further developed several of the story lines. In any case, this is a book that can be read over and over again. There are VERY few books that I read a second time, but this has been one of them. In the end, there are more questions than answers, and many of the questions are not resolved. I have not read any of the sequels because I heard they are really bad and I don't want to spoil this novel. This is one of the novels that put Clarke into the great three of sci-fi (with Heinlein and Asimov), and it won both the Hugo and the Nebula award. This novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology
4	4	THE CRANKY DAY is made up of three stories: Cranky Bugs, Put-Upon Percy, and Lady Hatt's Birthday Party. This inexpensive paperback is perfect for the Thomas fan. It has the colorful photographic "illustrations" that look like the series we're familiar with. This one is REALLY popular with my Thomas fans, and you can read the stories one at a time or all three at once. But beware -- when you're finished they're going to want you to read it again! and again! and again

4	4	The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended
1	1	Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!! I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book

1	1	The premise here is so engaging that I'm not surprised the author got it published, but basically, it's such a self-indulgent ramble that it's not worth the time of people other than the author. How can a person make the topic of James Bond and his 'disturbing world' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first 100 pages? If you'd like to know, read the first hundred pages of this book. Like many, I came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read. We're talking about James Bond here after all. The author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously, and that's fine, but in that case, we shouldn't have to be bored. I would strongly recommend not reading this book. It could have been covered in a long magazine article or, as I said, as the occasional comment on a blog about James Bond
0	0	When I was a university student 14 years ago, I followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so. In hindsight, it worked (as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym) but I picked up a copy of BRAWN a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results. This book is good for motivation, a trip down memory lane for some; it has some good ideas but generally the routines aren't suitable for anyone training without steroids. I wonder why Joe Weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many, if not all contributors, depended on steriods to realize their success...
4	4	Cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like Borges and Nabokov I return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them. I agree with previous reviewers - Cortazar's precision with language rivals Nabokov, Kafka, Proust or Borges. I would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of Ferlinghetti - Cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion, and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections. This is a great introduction to Cortazar, with many personal favorites: "Night Face Up," "Idol Of The Cyclades," "House Taken Over" and "Axolotl" are all unforgettable short fictions. I wouldn't stop there - Cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, ALL FIRES THE FIRE). Cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print. Thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them. -David Alsto
1	1	Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics. However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments. The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture. This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters

1	1	The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on
4	4	If one hears the name Sandburg, the first thing to come to mind is probably &quot;Fog&quot; or &quot;City of Big Shoulders.&quot; But in reading this wonderful memoir, we are reminded of what a fine prose writer the man was. The tale of his struggling Swedish immigrant parents finding their way in late nineteenth century America and young &quot;Charley&quot; as he liked to be called, as the name Carl marked him as a foreigner, is a fascinating glimpse of a bygone time and place. The interesting jobs that young Carl took on, such as traveling the back roads selling stereo-optican views, and his conversations with a civil war vet are rewarding and insightful. I believe this is a wonderful read for anyone with a love of biography, history, or simply good storytelling
3	3	"The Killing Sky" is the fifth book in Robert Gandt's great series of novels about Brick Maxwell, and it's one of the two best. (My other favorite is "Acts of Vengeance", the second book in the series.) Brick Maxwell is a U.S. Navy pilot and squadron leader, flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, stationed in the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. The story starts with a joint exercise with the Israeli Air Force ending with an American F/A-18 getting shot down for real! What went wrong? Did the Israeli pilot really push the missile launch button instead of just announcing a simulated kill? And why does the female Israeli Mossad agent make a play for Brick Maxwell? Is she trying to get information out of him or does she have other motives? This book contains the same three general plot elements as most of Robert Gandt's novels: - exciting "you're sitting in the cockpit" descriptions of modern Navy flight operations, with dogfights, carrier-based landings and takeoffs, and push-button warfare with modern smart bombs and missiles. - geopolitical machinations, this time involving high-level Americans and Israelis and Palestinians. And to keep the excitement up there are internal conflicts within each national group, including a really nasty American political envoy with presidential ambitions. - romantic involvement for Brick, this time involving not just one but two women. I liked this book a lot, despite the rather slow start. The suspense gets cranked up by the under-handed dealings going on between the politicians and the resulting armed conflicts between the Palestinians, the Israelis and the American forces. Is the United States really going to invade Palestine and engineer a democratic process, just like in Iraq? And who is really behind the decisions that are causing the continued escalation of hostilities? One of my criticisms of Robert Gandt's novels is that the characters don't really come across as real people. This is still true in "The Killing Sky", but less so than in the first books in the series, another plus for this book. Recommended for all fans of military action novels, as is the whole Brick Maxwell series. Rennie Peterse
0	0	This book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives, as it was to me, a survivor. It tells the story of one man in England, with moments that make you think there is a similarity, only to be disappointed. The only hope for the book is the wife's diary, and her feelings from the event through the treatment. But even then there is the feeling that her diary in censored, knowing that it would be published. The author does direct the reader to some other good books, and gives us a happy ending. The book does teach us that life goes on, even if you have a stroke, but stroke suvivors already know that fact
0	0	I had a 3 day detention to serve, 90 min's after each school day, so I went to the library originally looking for a book on engenering. I saw this instead, and decided to rent it out. When I got in the car, I noticed the table of content's had several racial comment's in the front, but I ignored it. After reading a few CH. I couldnt beleive this book, but I kept reading it, cause it was entertaining how much of an idiot Chuck D is. He is the reason some white people have negative veiw's of black people. Because he play's the role of a loser who blaims everything on the same people that put him where he is now. Why not just bite the hand that feed's you? If you are in the black Panther's, are obsessed with Chuck D, or just straight up hate white people I would suggest this book. The real reason I hate this book is I despise anyone who makes racist comment's against anyone at any time, and against any race. I myself am white, and there was 3 race riot's where I grew up, I got stabbed in 5th grade by a black kid my age, and my father was murdered before I was born by a black man... So why don't I just write a book against " My oppressor's ". This book show's that Chuck D is truely not a smart man, just a racist fool, who is no more smart then Flavor Flav. He need's to go back to first grade, and watch more barney, so he can learn to love everyone. But I guess he is just going to get his, ironically like his song " Your gonna get your's ". I can not express in word's how much I hate this book, and I feel ashamed for every buying It takes a nation..

4	4	Year after year I wonder how Koontz can continue to keep his writing fresh and entertaining. I worry that he will become like many other authors and become predictable and boring. Happily- this has NOT happened to Koontz. His last several books have only gotten better for me, I have a hard time putting them down! Life Expectancy starts off with a very interesting premise: Jimmy Tock's grandfather made a prediction on his deathbed the same day Jimmy was born, listing 5 terrible days in Jimmys future. Thus, the book begins and we are along for the ride to see what each of these 5 days hold in store for him and his family. Because the characters in this book are so enjoyable and loveable (as most of Koontz's characters are!) I found myself in anticipation really hoping that these days wouldn't destroy them... Other stand out features of this book: Not predictable at all- from start to finish. The ending was especially great in proving this point, as well as just great in general! It was pretty fast-paced and kept the pages turning and did not leave me bored for a chapter. The uniqueness of the story as well as the quirkiness. Lastly, to reiterate, the characters!! Koontz really goes above and beyond most authors I read (and I read A LOT) in creating not only fun, unique and loveable characters- but they are also very memorable! It's not often I can remember characters from a book in much detail, but Koontz has such a gift that I can recall many, many of his characters and always find myself sad when their story ends. I think that is the sign of an exceptional writer

1	1	The concept of whole language when implemented in California in the 80s was a total debacle and I see that there are still books out there promoting the &quot;whole&quot; concept, only this time it is in math. Use this book only in addition to tried and proven ways of teaching math

4	4	Mention the word "sadism" and the results it produces will vary from an embarrassed Victorian blush to righteous indignation that such things should exist at all, not to mention it being a topic for discussion among proper and civilized human beings. Yet to Thomas Moore, a former monk and Jungian analyst and writer, it is precisely this topic that needs to be explored mentally, even spiritually, in order to prevent it from erupting into anti-social, or even criminal acts in the flesh. Examining the writings of the infamous Marquis de Sade, Moore delves into the healing role of de Sade that digs deeper than the surface appearance of de Sade as pornographer to find value in what is cursorily dismissed as naught but tasteless perversion. According to Moore's analysis of de Sade's writing, the virgin needs the libertine to complement her chastity, as much as he needs her pristine purity to define who he is. Yet, a deeper understanding of Moore's treatise on de Sade reveals that wholeness is the object of the soul's journey, and that experiencing the self as holy--at the expense of being whole-- unjustly deprives the psyche of its completion. He believes that every human being should be in touch with his Sadean side-- at least mentally-- for human potential not explored is what cripples the soul. Just as there is no stick that has but one end, human potential and creativity must at least acknowledge, without necessarily favoring, the dark side of the psyche so that it's full complexity can be known and appreciated. For Moore, as well as for de Sade, the perverse side of the personna that is forbidden to manifest itself mentally becomes the powerful driving force for enactment in the psycho-socially mal-adjusted person. It is perhaps society's denial of our own dark eros that enrages and offends most when we see it demonstrated in others, for that denial surely perverts any attempt at self-knowledge, and forces the soul to assume a posture of balance and completeness that is false,lame, and ultimately unhealthy. Moore hints that without personal aknowledgment of the darker depths of our psyches, as de Sade so blatantly illuminates, we cannot hope to soar to our greatest heights, for what we resist persists, and the chains of denial keep us tethered to terra firma instead of flying the limitless skies of our Divinity. This book is not a quick read, nor is it for the judgmental or faint of heart. It requires time, and a certain willingness examine our own depths, not favoring the dark, forbidden aspects of our psyche, but rather admitting that a Sadean dark eros lies hale and hearty within us all, waiting to be revealed to honest introspection for spiritual growth through courage of heart.

For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be
4	4	I am one of those freaks who would look at a bezillion books before settling with one. (Talking about computer books ofcourse!). This is especially significant when it comes to XML because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away. This book does exactly that. You will start writing decent xml right away. The following will be helpful. 1. HTML knowledge (a little) 2. The concept of scripts 3. The concept of CSS 4. The concept of XML When I say 'the concept of', I am only talking about a surface level, "Purpose of existence" kind. Even if you don't know anything about XML, you will be fine with this book. The book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas. Peace.
1	1	This book was neither bad nor good and therefore leaves me with little inspiration to write a review. What must be said is that this book had great potential, which was never fully developed. The idea was good. Even some characters were good. Well, actually just Patrick. And come to think of it, I ended up liking Muffin (the cat) more than I did any of the other Mulvaneys. Though even as a cat lover, I got sick of hearing about Muffin and the other animals which were way too many in the first place. The book did go on and on, too much description about the ordinary (and, oh so cliche at times!).I didn't like the way it jumped between 3rd person and 1st person narrative. I didn't find it confusing, I just found it awkward. It didn't give the chance to really get inside Judd's head (I mean, it was "his" story after all). I couldn't love or hate anyone in the book. It was hard to tell what their motives were and "who" the real person was inside them. They seemed so in-and-out of character. Maybe that was the author's way of exposing them as phonies? I'm not sure. But without love or hate, there's really nothing left to feel as a reader. Left to chose between a ditzy mother, a jerk-of-a-father (but not a jerk enough to hate him or care about what happens to him), an eldest son who is like a prop in this book, a brainiac son who gets revenge only to disappear and become someone completely different without warning or reason, a victimized daughter, that you can't really feel all that sorry for, the youngest son (also a prop), I'm not sure who to root for (if anyone). The worst part was, just when I started warming up to the book (forgiving its flaws, hoping for a great ending), I was hugely let down. It took me about a week to finish the last 2 chapters because the end of the book just dragged and I found myself too tired to pick it up. We are told in a quick (but ironically again, long and tedious) after-the-fact fashion about what has become of Marianne and then in the Epilogue everything is "wrapped up" quickly and neatly with no realism whatsoever. I feel if you're going to resolve things in the end, then RESOLVE them---Tell us what it is and how it came to be without just glossing over everything. The book was long enough; some pages should have been assigned to the ending instead of all the fluff in between. This is a book that should make you cry, but I felt nothing (and I am one of the biggest crybabies ever). If you want a good book about family and family secrets, read Ann-Marie MacDonald's "Fall On Your Knees" or "The Way the Crow Flies" instead. Both excellent books.
4	4	Got a great book the other day called The Medici Effect: What Elephants & Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation by Frans Johansson. It about what happens when you step into that area called The Intersection... Contents: Part 1 - The Intersection: The Intersection - Your Best Chance To Innovate; The Rise of Intersections Part 2 - Creating the Medici Effect: Break Down the Barriers Between Fields; How to Make the Barriers Fall; Randomly Combine Concepts; How to Find the Combinations; Ignite an Explosion of Ideas; How to Capture the Explosion Part 3 - Making Intersectional Ideas Happen: Execute Past Your Failures; How to Succeed in the Face of Failure; Break Out of Your Network; How to Leave the Network Behind; Take Risks and Overcome Fear; How to Adopt a Balanced View of Risk; Step into the Intersection Notes; Index; About the Author The Medici Effect is all about the intersection of ideas, cultures, disciplines, and strategies in new and previously unexplored ways. The term comes from the Medici family in Florence Italy in the 15th century. A convergence of thinkers and doers all converged on Florence, which became ground zero for the Renaissance period. New concepts thrived in that environment where people were learning and listening to each other, breaking out of their own fields to combine ideas into revolutionary new areas of study. Johansson asserts (and correctly so, in my opinion) that innovation thrives in these "intersections" that are missed by many, but offer the best chance for breaking away from the "same old thing". The book is extremely practical, in that all the chapters are driven by real-life examples of these intersectional thinkers. You'll see how Richard Garfield combined the idea of collectables and gaming to come up with the mega-hit card game Magic: The Gathering. The singer Shakira takes musical styles from widely different cultures and combines them into a sound that is all her own (and very popular to boot). Eric Bonabeau studied the activities of ants searching for food and applied the observations to network routing and scheduling. These and many other examples show how being a generalist (or at least open to other fields) can lead to connections not possible for highly specialized thinkers. Johansson lays out steps you can take to place yourself in that constant flow of ideas, so that you can start seeing new possibilities in rather mundane unrelated things. I was very impressed with this book, and have already started to look at events and ideas in a different light. I'd recommend this read for anyone looking to spur their creativity beyond the norm...

3	3	Wayne Grudem has written a great deal about biblical manhood and womanhood. Besides articles in periodicals, he has written Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism which he co-authored with John Piper. He has written Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth: An Analysis of More Than 100 Disputed Questions and then two collections of essays he edited, Biblical Foundations for Manhood and Womanhood and Pastoral Leadership for Manhood and Womanhood. The latest addition to this list is Evangelical Feminism: A New Path to Liberalism?. Grudem describes this book as "an expression of deep concern about a widespread undermining of the authority of Scripture in the arguments that are frequently used to support feminism. It is also a way of posing a question: can a movement that espouses this many ways of undermining the authority of Scripture possible be right?" The book's argument, then, is that evangelical feminism sets those who affirm it on a slippery slope that will inevitably lead to liberalism. It is important to define terms and Grudem, always a deliberate author, does just this. By theological liberalism he refers to "a system of thinking that denies the complete truthfulness of the Bible as the Word of God and denies the unique and absolute authority of the Bible in our lives." And by evangelical feminism he means "a movement that claims there are no unique leadership roles for men in marriage or in the church." Leadership in both the home and the church is to be shared equally between men and women according to their gifts and desires. He leads readers through five points: 1. Liberal Protestant denominations pioneered evangelical feminism and now evangelical feminists have adopted many of the arguments earlier used by theological liberals to advocate women's ordination and to reject male headship in marriage. 2. Many prominent evangelical feminist writers advocate positions that either deny or undermine the authority of the Bible. Other egalitarians endorse books written by these people without taking a stance against those who deny Scripture's authority. 3. Recent trends show that evangelical feminists are heading towards the denial of anything uniquely masculine and some now even refer to God as "our Mother in heaven." 4. The history of others who have adopted these positions shows that the next step is the acceptance of homosexuality. 5. The common thread running through these trends is a rejection of the authority of Scripture in people's lives--the very bedrock principle of theological liberalism. These dire predictions aside, Grudem is careful to affirm that there are some egalitarians who continue to uphold the authority of Scripture (men like Roger Nicole, Walter Kaiser, Jack Hayford, etc) but warns that, while these men may remain orthodox, those who follow them will likely drift further and further from affirming the authority of Scripture, for this is a common pattern in the church. These men, despite their good intentions and their love for the Bible, may be inadvertently leading the next generation astray. Grudem provides a short chapter liberalism and women's ordination, showing that there is no theologically liberal denomination or seminary in the United States today that opposes women's ordination. This proves that liberalism and the approval of women's ordination go hand in hand. The heart of the book is contained in two sections. The first, with fifteen short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that undermine or deny the authority of Scripture. These range from saying that Paul's teaching on women's roles was just plain wrong, to suggesting that women may preach or teach men as long as they are under the authority of a pastor, to relying on experience as the arbiter of what is right and true. The second section, with ten short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that are based on untruthful or unsubstantiated claims. These include those who teach that Paul told the women in Corinth to "keep silent" because they were disrupted church services, that the word "head" actually means "source," and that the Son is not subordinate to the Father in the Trinity. Grudem concludes "I cannot say for sure. But I can think of no other viewpoint or movement within the whole history of the Christian church (except theological liberalism itself) that has generated so many novel and ultimately incorrect ways of interpreting the Bible." Having provided the facts and having provided brief analysis, Grudem finally seeks to understand where evangelical feminism is taking the church. He concludes that the next step is to deny anything distinctly masculine. At the foundation of evangelical feminism, he feels, is a dislike of manhood itself. This will lead to a denial that there is anything uniquely masculine about God and allow people to refer to God as Mother. The danger here, of course, is that calling God "Mother" "is changing God's own description of himself in the Bible. It is calling God by a name that he has not taking for himself. Therefore it is changing the way the Bible teaches us to think of God. It is thus changing our doctrine of God." The final step along this trajectory is the widespread acceptance of homosexuality. Those who advocate the morality of homosexuality within a biblical context are using the very same arguments used by evangelical feminists. Churches that accept the arguments of evangelical feminists will have very little ground to stand on when they attempt (or if they attempt) to uphold the biblical condemnation of homosexuality. What is ultimately at stake in evangelical feminism is the Bible itself. I appreciated Grudem taking his argument to its fullest extent and showing what is truly at stake here. Too often arguments about issues like evangelical feminism can proceed no further than the doctrine itself. I think Grudem has done the church a great service in showing and proving that this discussion is not merely about how particular churches operate. Rather, based on this discussion we can see which churches can remain faithful in the future and which will inevitably drift further and further from the authority of Scripture and thus further and further from God himself. If evangelical feminism is, indeed, a new path to an old problem, Grudem has shown just how seriously we need to take it
4	4	I was given this book recently and have to say it is probably the most inspirational travel book I have seen for many years. As a founder of an adventure travel company (Intrepid Travel) I see many books of this ilk - but this is altogether different and better. The pictures are fantastic and the copy very rreadable. It looks at 40 destinatiions - some mainstream, some off the beaten track. It makes you want to travel

I found out about it in Bible study class. My Senior Pastor, has a copy he got over 40 yrs ago, and still used. One of the best studying guides you can have in your library
3	3	The most redeeming quality of this title is its readability. Talbott is able to convey all the drama and excitment of life in international politics. That said, this certainly isn't a title which will help you get a complete understanding of India, Pakistan and nuclear weapons. I read this book to supplement required reading for a course on War in South Asia and it greatly helped in terms of reinforcing key events and players. I reccomend this to those who already have a reasonable understanding of the situation in South Asia and want a bit of light reading and would like to see the soap opera aspect of the affair.
1	1	I am a huge fan of the first Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift publication. I loved the book and have made three quilts that were inspired from the patterns found there. This sequel, More Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift is inferior on nearly every level. The patterns are not so interesting, and seem more fussy and complex. In addition, in this sequel publication, the patterns are not rated by level of difficulty, which I believe is a detriment. Finally, the actual quality of the book is not good. Within a day of bringing it home from the store, the cover of the book had curled up like a wood shaving! I think the authors would have done well to stick with the same publisher who put out their first effort. About the only good things I can say about the book is that the instructions seem clear and the photos of other color options are helpful
0	0	I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful. I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible. I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci. You can miss this one in my opinion
4	4	I used this book as a primary preparation tool for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. Being a beginner in EJB, I found this book to be very friendly. I liked the layout of the book in general and the writing style of the author in particular. Only relevant pieces of code are presented to focus explanation of topic in question. A complete running application may be downloaded from the author's website. The multiple choice questions at the end of every chapter and ALERTs in every chapter made remembering main points easier. Deployment descriptor elements are clarified in considerable detail and they are explained well. Please note that there are errors in this book - some of them are fairly obvious such as using a capital letter as opposed to a small letter (Java versus java) while others are not so obvious but noticeable by experienced java developers. Regardless of its minor faults, I consider this book to be a valuable addition to my library. Normally I would have a cut a star for the errors but because of its content quality, I felt compelled to give 5 stars. I just passed the exam today thanks to this book. I know that I will not hesitate to buy another book from this author. Thanks Mr.Sanghera! I recommend this book highly without any reservations whatsoever
1	1	I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
4	4	In a letter to the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers Solzhenitsyn writes, "Lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society, that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society, that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a fa√ßade." Cancer Ward is no fa√ßade. A truly moving story of life and death, disease and recovery, Cancer Ward is a novel with impact. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is they who tell the story. From loyal party member Pavel Nikolayevich to labor camp survivor Oleg Kostoglotov and through all the characters whose lives fit somewhere in between, the virtues and faults of socialism are examined, dissected, and layed out clearly for the reader. While his contemporaries were busy writing safe novels, novels which towed the party line and supported the prescribed views of Stalinism, Solzhenitsyn took a grave risk. He wrote novels which reflected truth. He wrote novels which portrayed the real life trials of the people. And, in the end, he wrote novels which were not published in the nation he so dearly loved. Make no mistake. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was no rebel. He truly loved his country and supported his government. His use of brutally honest literature was meant to strengthen his beloved country. It was Solzhenitsyn's hope that by portraying the weaknesses of his country he might help eliminate some of those problems. Alas, his works were largely ignored due to the unrelenting censorship of the Soviet government. Fortunately for the rest of the world his works were not lost. They found their way out of Russia and onto the stage of World Literature. For this we can all be thankful. Cancer Ward is an enriching novel and a worthy addition to anyone's library. This is not a book you want to pass up
4	4	This book is a masterclass for people wanting to start up, or revolutionise the marketing of, their seminars and workshops. It is jam packed with advice that really works. No padding, no wasted words. Most importantly, readers will learn how to maximise revenue from seminars and eliminate the risks. This book comes with the highest recommendation. I know it works. It has been a major source of inspiration for me when I started my own speaking business. The value of the book far outweighs its costs. Buy now and discover its secrets for yourself. Then apply the time tested principles and watch your business take off.
4	4	I found this to be one of the best Carole Matthews titles that I have read. Carole's books always present such interesting challenges faced by her protagonists when it comes to life and love, and this one is no exception. Set in a small village on the outskirts of suburban England, Carole does an excellent job in capturing what life is like in a small town, with neighbors watching your every move, speculating and spreading rumors that sometimes only have a sliver of truth to them. She even reveals how wrong people can be about what is innocent, and what isn't in a small town through hilarious antics of a housewife turned prostitute. The main character, Rose, is trying very hard to start a new life in a small town, but nobody wants to give her a break because they don't understand what she does as an aromatherapist, and mistakenly think she is a prostitute! As she settles in, she begins to fall in love with a local, who is going through his own relationship troubles. However, she is still torn by the affair that sent her fleeing from London. I couldn't stop reading as Rose tries so desperately to make the right decision, faltering for some time but eventually coming to terms with her feelings after a rather muddy encounter! A definite must for any fan of Carole Matthews, or British chic lit
0	0	While I was reading American Normal, I kept asking myself, why is he writing this book. Someone finally asks the author the same question, and his answer is, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I have a theory. Osborne started out to write a book showing that AS is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics. When halfway through the book his research shows him that it's quite a lot more than that, in fact a real syndrome completely different from just &quot;a little eccentricity&quot;, he is lost. He no longer knows why he is writing. He keeps mentioning drugs. There are no drugs in the treatment of AS itself. He keeps metioning psychiatrists. It's a neurological disorder, not a psychiatric disorder. He meets, casually, a few Aspies, and suddenly he's an expert. This book mostly made me angry, as it would anyone who knows someone with AS. He seems often to think the whole this is a joke. After all, he's eccentric, and he doesn't have it... Worst book I've read on autism yet. Pit
4	4	Whether or not astrology can help to predict events, this book gives many examples of how astrology has been used by people throughout a very long history. Although mention is made of a time when common folk, such as those attending the theater, understood astrological portents as a part of everyday life, the book emphasizes how famous and highly-intelligent people made use of astrology for worldwide matters, as well as for practical, personal application such as the time of death (even though some, given the knowledge, tried and failed to change the event). Choosing to elevate the traditional approach over the modern, psychological method is debatable, but the traditional progression in the book from Hitler to Bush is quite chilling. Well worth the read
4	4	I had my copy of Memoirs Found In A Bathtub confiscated by my 9th grade french teacher in 1977. Hey, it was a 30 minute free reading period. I learned of Kafka's influences on this book ,and their shared heritage, years later. Searching for knowledge can be a treachorous endeavor. The authorities and experts can't always be trusted - especially when they no longer have paperwork to bolster their position
1	1	I was disappointed in this book. I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to. I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things. Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well. The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story. There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line. I felt very let down at the end of this audio book
0	0	I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life. I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it. I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible. This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash. I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.
3	3	This is a very indepth library for an aspiring CCNA. These books are packed full of entry-level Cisco and networking knowledge. However, do not rely on these books alone to pass the CCNA. Be sure to pick up Todd Lammle's CCNA book to prepare you for the test

0	0	I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally, after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option
0	0	Sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but I was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book. Maybe I should have expected such based on the title, but I found it unsettling nonetheless
4	4	It is an awesome book. If you don't believe me and the other reviewers, go to the library and read it to see for yourself. It is definitely worth reading
0	0	A wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. He dropped his past standards on this book. Only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value. An unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized. I agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers: "The story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying." "The first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying." "Far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... Of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback." "Too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous." "...novel seems dark and pointless." "numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air." If you are new to Le Carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work
4	4	Obviously includes all the "A" list sites but everything else. If you get bored, don't blame this book.
4	4	This is the best book that I have read about Hemingway as a man. It doesn't pretend to be (and is not ) a biography. It is an intimate and deligthful portrait of Hemingway the fisherman, the hunter, the womanizer, the drinker, the gambler and all the things that really meant something to him. Were can you get such a descriptive account of the pain and insecurity associated with a writer's creativity? Without this book one cannot size the tragedy of a writer that, in his last years, was conscious of his inability to create great literature, but was condemned to live up to his myth and his character. To those that criticize this book, on grounds of lack of objectivity, one must oppose that this is a book about Papa like the one that he, when Paris was a moveable feast, would have wanted to write about Hemingway.........After all, if Papa lived, he would have explained to all of us that time is precious and that he took Hotchner under his wings, wined and dined and shared intimate thoughs and moments with him, only in order to provide the young lad with good story writing material. And Hotchner has delivered
4	4	Peter Drucker is a subject in and of itself. His insights into the movement of people and their actions are legendary within the business world. This book provides a clear, essential summary of his life work. If you are in business (which is most of us), if you are looking for ideas, or just plain interested in who thought up some of the &quot;common&quot; business maps of the day, chances are you can read this book and find out that they are all linked to Mr. Drucker. This is not your normal biography- there is real substance here
1	1	I have been a fan of Lois Lowry's books for years, and have appreciated some of the other ways she has handled disability before. That is why I had trouble with how she handled it in this book. Much of my family in the era this book is written lived in rural areas, and many were said to be "touched", with the same conditions that cause me, for instance, to be unable to speak or relate to people in the usual way. They were also accepted in their communities a lot more than I have been in modern urban settings, and none were a danger to their communities. I enjoyed reading about similar settings to the ones in my family stories. That is why the ending was so shocking. There is a stereotype of disability that has caused disabled people to be removed from our families for a long time. This one runs that we don't know any better, but have sinister tendencies lurking somewhere in our inability to understand certain things. It makes for a plot device that is accepted by many non-disabled people. Rain Man went to an institution and is supposed to stay there his whole life because he "might hurt the baby", even though there are ways of preventing that kind of thing without taking such drastic measures, and even though that kind of thing is not common among autistic people. The boy in this story does something similar, with similar results. To people unfamiliar with this stereotype, or who believe in it, this plot device may seem powerful, and a way of advancing the sensitivity of the main character who knows that he "didn't mean to do" what he did. To me, it seems like a shortcut. Many people in roughly that era were institutionalized because of widespread prejudices that they would hurt someone, or rape their sisters, or other things that turned out not to be how it usually actually happens. The story, to me, would have been more powerful by far if it had addressed those kind of real problems, rather than using the hackneyed storyline that is easier to write, perhaps, but advances those very same stereotypes. I wonder how many readers of this book will do the same sort of thing as one young mother did when she refused to allow me to board at her house because she had a small child and believed I would hurt him because I am autistic. That is the true danger in "They're dangerous, but they can't help it." I wonder what kind of thing she had heard and read to form a strange opinion like that. The author is a good author, and from the point of view of someone who might well have had the same social status in that era as the boy did, she could have written him, and even handled the issues around this kind of idea, much more responsibly
0	0	I was hoping this book would be a collection of monologues for women from plays that directors might have heard of! It appears they are written by the author and most are not appropriate for a serious audition. Feel like I wasted my money here.
1	1	This book says nothing. He brings you on a journey through nothing that will you unfilled. Don't read it
4	4	George Orwell, writer of such great classics as &quot;No Winston, two plus two is five&quot; and &quot;All animals are equal&quot; truely outdid himself with this book. His essay, &quot;Such, and Such Were the Joys,&quot; is worth the price of the book alone. The descriptions therein, in the vein of 1984, are detailed and vivid to the point where I almost feel as if I remember and understand Orwell's childhood better than my own. In this essay one also catches a glimpse of what made Orwell the writer he was: a poor, pessimistic, sickly lad whose talent could have created it's own entire cannon if he'd lived longer and enjoyed a more work conducive atmosphere. For every reader who breathes to read, this book is an oxygen tank. (like the one they have at the bottom of the slopes in Aspen.
3	3	Why is it so hard for us to give this man the credit he deserves? We've seen the movies and read the books. And yet, every time I see a book by John Grisham in Hangzhou, I think, "I don't have to finish reading it if I don't like it." I think of his value as trade bait, since he's so popular. And yet, I have never put aside a John Grisham book unread. What more does he have to do? Become less popular? The premise on the back cover is simple enough. A homeless guy takes nine lawyers hostage, somebody dies, and one of our lawyers is changed by the experience. You have no idea what an excellent novel can come from such a simple idea. I've read almost everything Grisham has written, and I can remember most of it, and I'd have to put this at the top of the list. He's a master of character, plotting, simplifying the complex, setting, words, and accessibility. The writer should do all the work so the reader doesn't have to. John Grisham, folks. He's the genuine article. Let's say it, okay?
4	4	I laughed out loud while I read this book. I was surprised that it is so slim, yet each story is packed with humor. The reader cannot help but enjoy the Professor's adventures in the crazy academic world of Philology. This is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors don't complain about the laughter
4	4	If you're into programming games for Pocket PC this is the book for you! An incredible resource that integrates the basics into an easily solvable puzzle
3	3	I love this story, I was loving it from page one up until the last comic. I mean here we have a great subtly running plot in Thorpe, Silver, and the deceased Doctor, but then suddenly in the last issue we see none of the three stories resolved. Yes, we are implied strongly that the doctor does away with thorpe, but that isnt good enough, what of Thorpe's Empire, how does Batman find out, and do we ever see the ghost again, maybe we don't, maybe we're better for it. But as for Silver, at least I was sad to see her walk away as yet another Superhero-girlfriend-itis casualty and not have anything more happen along the lines of her life in general, or Batman's general dealing with it. Anyways, at least these were just issues and not an intended mini-series, so all of these qualms are pretty much null and void. As a whole, ITS AN AWESOME STORY
4	4	Finally,, this book was just what I have been looking for. I've been diligently searching for information on how my lesbianism would effect my daughter and the sterile studies I found just didn't seem to satisfy my quest. I found comfort from this book and in knowing who she becomes depends on all the factors of parenting and not just the fact that I'm a lesbian. This collection outweighs the studies because the honesty of the writers provided rare and precious information. I hope volume two is in the works and perhaps we will hear from some more artificial insemination babies. Thanks to the writers and editors for letting these voices be heard loud and proud
1	1	I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character. Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me. 2 star
1	1	This is a really thin book, and for the price, the production value is terrible. The graphic design, and poor layout, takes a lot away from the information of the book. Page after page, you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s. The information was light, and just skimmed over details. There was WAY too much emphasis on Analog. There are other search softwares out there. The case studies were nice, but no real insight was given. Overall - it's an overpriced fluff book. Could be summaried in 5 pages
3	3	For an avid reader like myself, it's often tough to know what to read next. In this book, Nancy Pearl helped me get quite a few suggestions. The book is helpfully broken up into little chapters about different genres or subjects, such as Action Heroines. I found it great, because if I'm not interested in that particular subject, I can just skip to the next section. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book 5 stars was that the summaries about the books are way too short. I really couldn't tell whether I'd like the book or not until I had come and read a few of the book's reviews on Amazon. All in all, this is a marvelous book, chock full of great suggestions for the casual and avid reader. I recommend it wholeheartedly
0	0	This is easily the worst book in the E&E series
3	3	When Michael Nyman first published this work in the 70s, it was the only book of its kind to discuss some of the most cutting-edge stuff going around. Most musical texts avoided discussing the Fluxus group as &quot;music,&quot; but Nyman integrates these radicals easily, and provided the first discussion of the Scratch Orchestra (Cardew et al), and related topics. The book still contains some of the clearest discussions of these topics around. It's great to have it back in print, though too bad Nyman couldn't be bothered to provide updates on some of the folks discussed, like Hugh Skempton
4	4	Around the World in Eighty Days, by Jules Verne, is a novel set in 1872, when technical revolutions allow a man to travel around the world in eighty days. But, to all the members of the Reform Club but one, this is only correct theoretically. However, to Mr. Phileas Fogg, this is a practical number. He then wagers twenty thousand pounds that he can make the journey. So Mr. Fogg and his newly acquired servant, Passepartout, immediately set out for their first stop- Suez. There they encounter a detective named Fix, who has heard news of a robber that fits Mr. Fogg's description exactly. Fix, wanting the reward of five percent of the fifty-five thousand pounds stolen, makes it his business to stop the `criminal' at all costs. Fix, believing that the wager is just a ruse to get the cops off his tail, thinks that Mr. Fogg will not follow through with this journey around the world. All goes smoothly, seeing as Fix is unable to attain a warrant for Mr. Fogg's arrest, until the railway that they are traveling on from Bombay to Calcutta, much to their surprise, is unfinished! Fortunately, thanks to Mr. Fogg's cunning ways, the party is able to buy an elephant to travel the fifty miles to the next railway station. On the way to the next railway station at Allahabad, they see a young woman being carried by Indian savages. An acquaintance, Sir Francis, explains that she is going to be sacrificed. Mr. Fogg, having gained twelve hours, decides to save the woman from a painful death. Aouda, as it turns out, is royalty to a village in India. But, since the savages will stop at nothing to find her, it becomes necessary to take her to her cousin in Hong Kong, which is conveniently one of the stops on Mr. Fogg's journey. But, much to the party's dismay, the relative has moved to Europe. Fix, hoping to delay the party, gets Passepartout knocked out on opium, keeping the valuable information that the Carnatic, the vessel from Hong Kong to Yokohama, is leaving that night instead of tomorrow morning. However, to Aouda's sorrow, the party finds another privately owned boat to take them to Shanghai, leaving Passepartout behind. The party decides to go to Shanghai because that's where the steamer to San Francisco starts, then stops at Yokohama and Nagaski, then departing for San Francisco. Much to the party's delight, they find out that Passepartout actually did make it aboard the Carnatic before it left, and they had a reunion aboard the San Francisco steamer. The steamer makes it into the San Francisco bay on the third of December, and Mr. Fogg has neither gained nor lost a day. The party then takes a rail passage from San Francisco to Ogden, only impeded by a herd of bison for three hours. On the way from Ogden to Omaha, however, a band of Sioux Indians attacks the train. Three passengers are captured, including Passepartout! Mr. Fogg does his duty, and rescues Passepartout. Fix, now having his best interests to get Mr. Fogg back to English soil as soon as possible, tells of a sledge that can be taken to the city of Omaha, where trains are plentiful. They take the trains to New York without stoppage. However, upon arriving at New York, they find out that the China, the steamer going to Liverpool, left only forty-five minutes beforehand! Mr. Fogg's party is able to board a private boat, for two thousand pounds each. He then `persuades' the crew to set sail for Liverpool. A storm makes the crew resort to steam power only. They run out of coal and have to burn the wooden parts of the ship, which Mr. Fogg buys off the owner for sixty thousand dollars. They take a rail line from Queenstown to Liverpool, gaining twelve hours on the steamers. The arrive in Liverpool at noon on the twenty-first, leaving only eight hours and forty-five minutes to get to the Reform Club. But, much to Mr. Fogg's surprise, he is arrested by Fix. But the thief had been caught three days before! After a three-hour delay, they charter a train to London, where they arrive at 8:50-five minutes too late. The next day, Mr. Fogg and Aouda decide to get married. When Passepartout runs off to find a reverend, he learns that it's only the 21st instead of the 22nd! Mr. Fogg arrives at the Reform Club at the preset time, winning his wager! By traveling east, he had gained a day during his journey, allowing him to win his wager. Jules Verne does a great job balancing facts and excitement in this novel. He provides an exciting science-fiction story, while giving some great info on places around the world. I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure, or whoever has dreamed about going around the world
4	4	Dave Barry writes as though he were Elmore Leonard on speed. It is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility, but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things cannot happen, such people cannot actually exist. Quite. Like Leonard, Barry's characters get their motivations, a lot of them, from the draw of the illegal, the desire to make big quickly. They are such strange people, each one perhaps, just, possible, and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real. And Barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy, leaving his readers poised to fall either way, and laughing the entire time, both from the absurd humour and from relief. I don't know how many other books Barry has since written, novels, i mean, not his humour columns (this was his debut fiction), but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone. They, the columns, aren't even in the same realm, let alone league
4	4	This was the first book I've read by Toni Morrison, and it did not disappoint. The story takes place in Ohio in the early 1940s - before the Civil Rights era, before Martin Luther King, Jr., and before Rosa Parks ever stayed seated on the bus. The story is told mainly from the focus from a young black girl about another young black in the neighborhood. The other black girl, Pecola Breedlove, comes from a family that is poor with a father who is an alcoholic. Pecola is considered ugly and her greatest wish is to have blue eyes, as she firmly believes this will make her beautiful. Naturally, the story involves much more than this, and Toni Morrison weaves a story that catches the reader up from the very first words and doesn't release them until the final page is turned. Ultimately, the idea of self-loathing is plainly seen - not just within Pecola, but within an entire community, an entire race. Pecola's story is not a pleasant read, yet it is difficult not feel a tenderness for this child. She begs to be nurtured. Many people who saw me reading this book told me it was a "black" book, but I disagree. The idea of self-loathing - either within oneself or within a community - is not specific to any one group of people, to my way of thinking. However, Toni Morrison has so captured the feelings and forced the reader to face them, that this book speaks to any and all who opens the pages. No child should be made to feel they are less simply because of who they are. A very moving book, highly recommended.

4	4	Recently, I have read a lot of books on Creativity and Innovation. My big surprise is that virtually none of them mention Koestler's The Act of Creation. This is unfortunate because this book is probably the most authoritative examination of creativity. Attention to this classic is worth reviving. Koestler examines three types of creativity - Humor, Science, and Poetry. Humor, according to him, is cruel (a valuable insight). Poetry, and other forms of art, integrate oneself with the World. Science occupies the neutral middle. It is amazing how Koestler manages to link all three kinds of creativity with a common framework. My two biggest take-aways from this book are regarding the process of creation and its form. As Koestler describes beautifully - "..uncovers, selects, re-shuffles, combines, synthesizes already existing facts, ideas, faculties, skills. The more familiar the parts, the more striking the new whole." This is corroborated by all geniuses who have stood `on the shoulder of giants'. Even inventors like Edison fit this framework. This is close to saying that instead of thinking `outside the box', link several boxes to each other. The other great insight is that the final breakthrough is rarely verbal, but in images. So people see new insights in a dream-like trance, rather than expressing it in language. Language, probably, impedes creativity. There are several more delightful and relevant insights on creativity in this masterpiece. Nearly a bible on creativity.
4	4	Outstanding book. I was lucky enough to meet Lyle Bouck. I can honestly say, he is one of the finest men I have ever had a chance to meet. There is no reason this man should not have won the Medal of Honor. A great read, and excellent job on telling the story of these heros
4	4	I think I've now bought 6 copies of this book, for my own library, to lend to people who are interested and might benefit, and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering Hospice, or their grieving families after a loved one's death. I have Stage IV - advanced, terminal or incurable (take your pick) breast cancer. I've been in treatment, continually adjusting as best as I can to new treatments, new worries and new symptoms, trying to preserve as good a quality of life as possible along the way. Meanwhile, Final Gifts has helped me accept and move towards the idea of quality of death being an important event for me and those I love. Once I give up treatment, or treatment fails me (whichever comes first), I've arranged for a local Hospice organization to help my husband and I cope, at home. Having read Final Gifts, it was easier for me to go ahead with planning my graveside funeral according to my culture and preferences, to hire a local stone cutter to design my headstone together - he has since completed it, other than the date of death, so it will be ready to mark my gravesite a week after I'm buried, and even to write my own obituary (to the extent that I know the information). All this is done, a relief - even a pleasure, to have had a say beforehand, and Final Gifts, which I and then my husband read over a year ago, provided the impetus, and the hope for a death with dignity and beauty

0	0	This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative
0	0	This has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised. The author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory, the book will say that it does not happen this way. The author seems to wax poetic, however, he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems, for example, I defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under IUPAC rules. All you want is a simple list , for example, 1) find the longest chain of carbons, 2) ......... instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life. Another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter, but NO answers in the back. If you want the answers, you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual. My condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by the publisher, the only advice I can give is that you purchase the solutions manual, because this gives some very detailed explanations. Good luck, because you will need it
4	4	It's hard to begin to praise Leigh Montville's biography of baseball's greatest slugger ever. There's a prelude written in a 'foggy,' uncertain-of-detail prose style which deals with the young George Herman Ruth's being committed to a 'boy's school,'and then drops into a dead-accurate lowdown which Montville researched diligently, right down to the brothers and young 'Nigger Lips's' discovery of the game and his rapid mastery. Montville tells true stories about The Babe's slugging, eating, drinking and sexual prowess in sometimes drop-deadpan humour, and he's a hell of a sportswriter as well. Three cheers for Montville and the Babe!!! (But hey,who hit a lifetime .371?
4	4	This work is a testiment to Chester Himes' brilliant insight and characterstic of the schitzophrenic relationship most extremely talented black artists have had with America. Much praised for his urban crime series, his more politically charged work was often ignored. This book and the truths it reveals about America's ability and inclination to create entire groups of people with nothing to lose speaks volumes about today's society as it did when written by the author. Many who read this will be afraid, as well they should. You will be entertained none-the-less, and hopefully inspired to think. The ending leaves something to be desired, I suspect that is because Mr. Himes was not alive to complete it himself
0	0	This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius.
3	3	Famous mathematicians have often emphasized the role of visual intuition; e.g., Hilbert: &quot;Who does not always use along with the double inequality a &gt; b &gt; c the picture of three points following one another on a straight line as the geometrical picture of the idea &quot;between&quot;? Who does not make use of drawings of segments and rectangles enclosed in one another, when it is required to prove with perfect rigor a difficult theorem on the continuity of functions or the existence of points of condensation?&quot; (from his famous address at the 1900 International Congress). This book is a collection of well over 100 one-page proofs, collected from various sources. The topics range from number theory to calculus, and most of them require no advanced mathematics. Typically there is a statement of a result, with a labelled diagram showing how it is &quot;proved&quot;; in some cases there are a few auxiliary equations along with the picture. These are not simple, often requiring quite a bit of thought before the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment. Working through them is a valuable exercise for the student of mathematics--having seen, e.g., six different visual proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, one comes to really *understand* the result, not just &quot;follow the logic&quot;. I have not encountered any better way than this book to &quot;see&quot; how mathematical truth is discovered and proved. It can be valuable as a supplement to courses through precalculus and elementary calculus. Perhaps one of its best uses is to inspire teachers to present results in a more lively way then &quot;definition-theorem-proof&quot; or &quot;just memorize it&quot;
4	4	Nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel. A large part of Conrad's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative. Nostromo describes the penetration of a Latin American country by European/North American capitalism and the ensuing revolution. All the characters in Nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward. Conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary Latin America and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping. The psychological elements concern characters' motivations for their acts. A recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se. Unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character, Nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by Conrad. The focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot, a brilliant piece of formal construction. Finally, Nostromo features some of Conrad's best descriptive writing. Because of the complexity of the plot and characterization, Nostromo is not the easiest of Conrad's novels to read. Nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended
4	4	The intimate stories of the cultural changes that represented the 1950s are told by one who was at the center of the storm: Andy Warhol. In his studio, the Factory, he created large canvases of what came to define Pop Art, listened to music which reflected a radical new generation's energy, and remained at the hub of the avant garde. No other book recreates the pop atmosphere of the times - and any reader of 1960s history and culture must have it. Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc
4	4	I had the privilege of spending an afternoon at the Long Island home of Pietro Di Donato many, many years ago when a friend of mine, John Liscio,took me to visit. Mr. Di Donato's father, I was told, died when he fell into a vat of cement back in the days when there were no labor laws to protect workers. The book was shaped from this incidence. Powerful book, and an even more powerful man. Both left an indelible impression
4	4	This book is one of the best I've ever read. I rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but I just couldn't stop reading. Mr. Richardson starts by explaining the culture of the Yali tribe, then moves to the life and background of Stan Dale. Seeing the providence of God at work as the third part brings the Yali tribe and Stan Dale together is remarkable. Stan Dale's conviction, comittment, and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ
4	4	I couldn't put this down, from the first fishing trip that turns into a life-changing trap, to the final decisions two young men--and older men--have to make about their history, their lives and their role in re-living or changing history. Powerful book. Highly recommended
3	3	The brave Anna Politkovskaya reveals the reality of Russia today in this sad, sometimes horrifying book. After a brief window period of freedom under Yeltsin, Russia has rapidly become a vast swamp of corruption, oppression and deception under Putin. Politkovskaya tells of the trouble and suffering of ordinary people who are humiliated and exploited by the criminal nomenklatura. For example Nina Levurda, who in trying to establish the truth about her son's death in the Chechen War, became a victim of this system that when not cruel, is completely indifferent to the individual. This and other cases are discussed in the chapter My Country's Army And Its Mothers. In Russia, people imitate the man at the top, thus Putin is the one who shapes Russian society. It is mainly he who is to blame for the brutality and extremism prevalent in the army and the state apparatus. There are sections dealing with war criminals, brutality against privates in the military, government complicity in crime, the corruption in the judiciary, the struggle to survive in places like Kamchatka, and racism against people with a non-Slavic appearance. Russia's stability is of a monstrous type, where power means everything, few people hold the law in any regard, bribes keep business and the state running, and a free press has almost disappeared. Putin's bureaucrats have taken corruption to new records, unheard of even under Yeltsin or the Communists. As a lieutenant-colonel who never made it to the rank of colonel, he has the mentality of a Soviet secret policeman. The Yukos affair and the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrate what a vindictive little man Putin is and how he is steering the country towards fascism. This process of crushing dissent and stifling freedom has been escalating throughout Putin's first presidential term and shows no sign of abating during the second. The Western press has mostly not showed great interest in this slide to oppression in Russia. It is hard not to write Russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book: the deliberate cruelties, the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media. Mercifully there are still people like Politkovskaya and Lev Ponomarev who are brave enough to speak out. This disturbing book concludes with explanatory notes containing references.
4	4	I was quite surprised to see a biography of James Tiptree, Jr. at all, let alone such a magnificent one. Ms. Phillips has done an amazing job at bringing both the woman and the writer into clear focus. I can't imagine that any details of Tiptree/Sheldon's life are not captured here. Certainly a must read for true sci-fi fans and well as those curious about the history of women's role in our society. This bio will win several awards, no doubt about it. Quite simply all you could ask for in one volume
4	4	As an executive coach and facilitator of leadership transformation, I was inspired my the author's personal journey of growth and transformation. The feel was authentic, and reflected a deep committment to fulfilling a higher purpose. I personally found many answers to problems that perplexed me. It has also been a source of wisdom to support and empower those around me in both formal and informal settings. Looking for a purpose for being? You will find some answers here
4	4	I find this book very easy to read. It is fraught with valuable, profound, substantial insights. It will rapidly acquaintance people who are not yet familar with MBA topics and it will solidify the knowledge of veterans in these issues. So, either way you win. Also, even though this book is intended mainly for service providers (doctors, lawyers), it can be easily extrapolated to any managerial work at whatever stage.

0	0	The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you. I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many "meals in 30 minutes" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly. Really quite silly. I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you. It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally. Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying
3	3	This is a fascinating book! Kurin gives a color and life to the history of the Hope Diamond, showing the interesting characters and lives touched by the "curse" and also those lives that have been positively affected by the diamond. There are photos, paintings, illustrations, and cartoons interspersed in the text to help bring alive the history of the gem. The writing was smooth and accessible and I truly enjoyed the look into history and past cultures as the author brought us on a world and historical tour of the Hope Diamond
1	1	This book is really geared toward women who are into feminism. All the quotes in the book are from women in her groups. If you're not into the female-identity world, pick another book
0	0	It seems that people either love it or hate it and I belong to the latter category. How did this become a classic??? Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage
0	0	I really did love his collaboration with Deepak on Living Beyond Miracles, but I am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. If you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, Deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. I get really tired of hearing Wayne regurgitate other people's work. It is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work. And when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on Maui, I was actually a little bit offended in that I felt sorry for the audience. (I saw this on PBS) At first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. I have heard him do this in every single audio work I have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from. I know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. Too bad! Without it, he could change so many more people's lives
4	4	For an student or practitioner of adverstising and marketing, this is a "must read" and a personal library staple. Yes, the examples may be dated, but the concepts are still operable. You should read their "Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind" first. Though based on Von Clauswitz (set piece warfare), there is much to be learned. Include Sun Tzu The Art of War in your library as well. Not that I have an opinion
0	0	If a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that Adams makes about Thomas Eakins, one would think that the artist was homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, and a pedophile, exhibitionist, voyeur, sadist, and masochist; and further, that he practiced incest and bestiality (all of which, Adams suggests, was driven by a desire to posses his own mother). Take your pick! Adams covers all the bases. Eakins is not so much "revealed" in this book as he is "concealed." He seems to ignore altogether, what to my mind, are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man: that he studied logarithms for fun, that science, not art, was his first love, that he was conversant in five languages, and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness. Among the more humorous assertions that Adams makes about Eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor (he used an easel), that he shot his sister's cat for fun (Adams conveniently leaves out the fact that Eakins' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid), and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses, which supposedly reminded Eakins of outfits his dead mother wore. After reading this dreadful book I came to actually like it as a study of how inbred (dare I say incestuous?) that some members of our academic community have become. Even if you are convinced, or want to believe that Abraham Lincoln was homosexual, you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously
4	4	Watching Fred over the years has brought me alot of respect for the game. This book brings me more respect for him as a person. We all wonder what it takes to be a superstar, this book details that very thing. I am proud to see a writer who can step inside and describe a person like kathlene bissle did. Fred touches so many people in our precious game of golf. We Fred thank you and your author for allowing us to step inside of your life an explore
4	4	I, like most of my women friends I've talked to, including my mother and my sisters, shape memories and moments based on the clothes we were wearing at the time. I bought this book in 1995 when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support. I found it in the "Self-Help" section of the bookstore. This little book does as good a job as anything I've read, at getting in a woman's head. Clothes are how we remember. Wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope. For a while, I kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever I'd want to remember an important event. Ask me what I was wearing when I held my niece for the first time (navy blue A-line Liz Claiborne dress) or when I went to my first job interview out of college (a polka-dot suit I called The Stewardess) or the night I was first kissed by the love of my life (a shirt that said "Keep On Truckin" in glitter... heh). A good friend's mother passed away a few months ago, and I bought a copy for her, since Ms. Beckerman mentions the death of her own mother. She also mentions marriages, divorces, babies, and career successes, and most importantly, what she wore. It makes a great gift for any woman. Or for yourself
0	0	Okay, maybe I am greatly missing something, and someone can inform me of where they are, but I couldn't find most the guys sources. There were numbers beside certain facts, but I looked into the back of the book, and everything, and found NO connection with the numbers listing where the fact originated. I went to the index, and what was listed as recources, but they had NO connection with the numbers which were listed besides the facts in which he put forth. When I read a book which is suppose to expose new information to me, I would expect there to be an extensive list of sources so that I can look up the information and the people in which he obtained the information from. What I found in the resources section were links to papers I should read which all contain biased info which were mainly on why you should eat Vegan. I don't deny that the guy truly believes what he is doing is right, and that he is truly trying to help people, but the fact that I can't find sources bothers me. Anyways, this guy talks about how great it will be to live long -- personally, I could give a crap....last thing I want to be is freaking 50yrs old, but that is just my opinion. I don't get what the point of him writing numbers beside facts was if he isn't going to back those numbers up with source information. Read at your own risk. There is always the chance that I obtained a copy which left out this information, or that I am just missing it, but until I see a source list on his information, and am able to see completely the studies he includes, which talk about people living longer, being healthier, etc, then I can't fully believe him
1	1	You guessed it. I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book. I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do. Sorry
3	3	Not the best Anne book, but good! :-) It's 'good' to see some conflict in Anne and Gilbert's marriage instead of the sweet but forced bliss in ANNE OF WINDY POPLARS and ANNE'S HOUSE OF DREAMS
4	4	Professor Eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism. Focus is placed on postmodernism's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism's contribution in the arts and architecture. This, in fact, could well be the subject of an entirely new book, however, aesthetics, in this case, is not Eagleton's main concern. It probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy, postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text, however, someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book (dictionary in hand) without too much difficulty. By definition, post modernism is hard to define, as it claims no foundational tenets: it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy. As Eagleton writes, "It is animated by the critical spirit, and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions." (P.26) From a socio-political standpoint, postmodern theories are part of a culture of "unmaking". It can be characterized as a rejection of all "metanarratives" or "grandnarratives"; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the `canon', a snubbing of intellectual elites, a blurring between high and low art, where Bart Simpson sits comfortably with Shakespeare. I would characterize it as a cynical "anti" position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society. The key principles of all postmodern theories include: "...decreation, disintergration, deconstruction, decentrement, displacement, difference, discontinuity, disappearance, demoralization and delegitimation." (Post Modern Theory, Best, Kellner, 1991) In one respect, Eagleton applauds postmodernism's huge body of work over a short time, and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions, though, criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories. There is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as Derrida, Lyotard or Kristiva, but after wading through their dense and at times "cult-like" prose, one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism, realising that these theories are empty rhetoric, that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie, a "grand-narrative" to keep us chained. For the most part Eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of Marxism and socialism, and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism's na?ve, almost adolescent view of the present world situation. He concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present. That there are many possible futures, including fascism: how would postmodern theory shape to such a future? In my opinion, not too well. This book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory.
4	4	My five-year-old son loves this book. The first time, I read it out loud to him and his sister. He has read it alone several times since then. I think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he doesn't finish it in fifteen minutes. The story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example, how Elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles. I also asked my son what he liked about it, and he said, "Dragons." He might have given a longer answer if he hadn't been busy reading the book at the time
4	4	I couldn't put it down. I think it really sets the reader up with a better understanding of Iran in the 20th century, and how things have gotten so out of hand there now 26 years after the ordeal ended
4	4	If you wanted to write a game for a PocketPC device this would absolutly be your book. However, I've been writing utility applications I find myself using this book over other references. This is the best lightweight WinCE/PocketPC progamming book out there- games or not. Harbour covers topics in a very easy-to-understand way- from graphics and sound to networking. No matter what the issue I usually go to this book first, then then web, then one of the other WinCE books I own if need be. If you're new to WinCE (esp. coming from a non Win32 background) this book is exceptionally great
0	0	This is one of the worst (maybe the worst) books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing. The author and the publisher are insulting the intelligence of readers by publishing such a stupid book. The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is "How Technical Analysis Works" by Bruce Kamich. Husam Abu-Haimed, Ph.D.
4	4	Intellectual, straight-forward, candid and objective-&quot;From Slavery to Freedom&quot; gives the actual picture of how African-Americans have been treated and where they stand in American History. An honest journey into history- well-researched. Thanks Franklin. History is important. But &quot;we shall rise&quot;
3	3	I've just reread "The Cat Who Smelled a Rat." In it, Jim Qwilleran is still in fine mettle. This mystery, No. 23 in the "Cat Who" series, is the last one most fans will enjoy. In this book, Qwill still remembers small details from previous novels. He's still interested in the mysteries around him, and he does some active snooping around. He's still a bit of the Lothario despite himself. And he still has faith in Koko's awesome powers. Starting with the next book, the mystery gets solved almost by accident. Qwill becomes a parody of himself, and the novels start to get worse and worse. Eventually, the books begin to get facts wrong and characters begin to act, well, out of character or just inexplicably drop out of sight. (The latter must be hard to do in a small town 400 miles north of anywhere.) Whether Lilian Jackson Braun, now approaching 90, has lost her touch, or whether they're being ghost-written, I leave to you to judge. But the books become just dreadful. I recommend that readers go out on a high note and stop after No. 23. It's been a good run
1	1	I found this book to be dull, pretentious, and without any merit. Growing up in the south must have been difficult, but I fail to see what this memoir has to do with anything other than the author showing off his checkered past and large vocabulary. Yaw
4	4	This book is an excellent way to introduce solids, liquids, and gases. I used it with a 3rd grade class and it was perfect
0	0	Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star
4	4	When I first obtained Partners in Crime by J.A. Jance, I had no idea the story was taking place in Bisbee, in Cochise Co., Arizona, which only added delight to my reading enjoyment. I lived in Sierra Vista which is also in Cochise Co. a few years ago, and I must say the descriptions were pretty much to the location. For me it was a step back in time. Which made it a 5 star for me. I came in contact with sodium azide when my vehicle ran into a brick wall, which was a choking situation. Maybe it will serve a purpose if everyone would contact their state representatives about how the substance is being left in discarded vehicles. It was refreshing to find a female sheriff in Bisbee, AZ, it being a macho town like so many of the border towns. However Sheriff Joanna Brady does very well being a newcomer investigating a murdered Rochelle, who was in the witness protection program; a second murder, and having to share the investigation with Beaumont. I enjoyed the mystery; it was a quick read with wonderful memories for me.
4	4	I owe my latest payday to Jack Chapman's negotiating strategies. My newest employer aimed pretty low for their first offer, lower than what I had made at my last job, considering all of the skills and experience I was bringing to the table. But by applying some of the techniques in the book, I was able to get 22% more money. I've never negotiated my salary before: I was just glad someone thought enough of my skills to make me an offer. Now, I know better
4	4	This classic is one that everyone should read and maybe even read every year!!
4	4	This text helped me to articulate the 'principles' of Standard English by examining our language in all its varieties scientifically and intuitively. Such articulation necessates a thorough understanding of the notions of descriptive vs. prescriptive, standard vs. nonstandard, formal vs. informal, grammatical vs. ungrammatical, and constitutive vs. regulative. This introductory text is written for the mature student who has had little or no background in linguistics or traditional school grammar. Consequently, the authors begin by demonstrating how traditional grammar instruction with its eight parts of speech and semantic definitions falls terribly short of accounting for the many rule exceptions and illogicalities of langauge. I highly recommend this text for English Education majors and secondary school English teachers.
4	4	I've always had a thought about "REVERAND" Jackson, and this book proves it! Jesse jackson isn't black - He's just a white man that's so full of s**t tha his body long ago lost the ability to absorb it
4	4	Imagine a world where the church ran everything. Sound good? Well, it's not. Just like in the middle ages, this church rules with an iron hand. Since God must be with the church, then opposition to the church is considered witchcraft, and it seemingly comes from Satan. A wonderful view of the negative possibilities should one single religion ever really take over the world. Lieber is a master writer, and this is one of his very best novels
4	4	I loved it and look forward to more of her books. The lead character was very likable and it was fun watching her journey through the break-up and divorce and how she was able to cope.

4	4	I can use "picture book" to describe Full Moon, as images contributed as the major part of this book. Don't think that this book is not worth reading, indeed, it is on the contrary, this is an extraordinary book, because of the photos. There are a lot of astronomy books contain lots of photos, but when you read them, you would find the images are not so good at all, but not because of the photo itself, because of the low resolution. And if you are familiarize with those photos, you would immediately notice that the original photo is not so small in resolution. It is really a very bad idea for the publisher and editor to ignore the importance of image resolution. However, when you first look into Full Moon, you will find you're getting into a different world as you are already delighted by the spectacular images of the Moon taken from Apollo Mission. Normally, owing to the technological limitation in 1960s and 1970s, all images are only mostly available as hard copy and not so high resolution. However, Project Full Moon can turn those hard copies into very high resolution images. I can even tell you that, NASA even don't have such high resolution images before. Since these reasons, I would rank this book as my list of Top 10 Astronomy Book. If you really love astronomy, you must not miss this book, miss the extraordinary journey to the Moo

1	1	I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down. Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that. The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour. It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read. The book just stops. Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel. It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with. In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae. Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that. Gee, what a lovely sofa..

Pissed off at the world, pissed off at life, and very lucky I didn't get my hands on him. Snipers are crazy as another review stated, but this guy is that 5% of the Corps that that can give the other 95% a bad name. Some of the boredom issues were true, wives/girlfriends dumping us was true, etc... but overall this guy just REALLY ticked me off... but THAT IS HIS GOAL IN LIFE ISN'T IT... Books about God, Country, Corps; things that are still thought, and observed by every Marine may just not shock the masses as much as a book aboutsome discontented, nonhacker, shiptbird.
1	1	I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
1	1	The book contains the complete works of Arthur Rimbaud in chronological order, in both English and French. There is an excellent short introduction to Rimbaud, along with a very nice explanation of the translation process, and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry. Sadly, the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to Rimbaud. In his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation, Mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems. Even though my French is inadequate to enjoy Rimbaud in his original language, I found myself turning frequently to the French versions of the poems, as I tried to understand how a poet of Rimbaud's reputation could possibly write so poorly. In poem after poem, the French version was more readable than Mason's translation even though I could only understand about a third of what I read. I ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by Paul Schmidt, which was much more readable. Ironically, Mason offers criticism of Schmidt's translation in his book. While this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with Rimbaud, I would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation

0	0	Overall, this book was terrible. I will start with the few excellent points this book made: Many celebrities have horrendous families (3 kids from 3 different men, for example), but this is overlooked while it is practically the only thing people say about poor women (ex: "Welfare Mothers"). The chapter on Welfare Mothers had lots of good points in it-it was worth reading. They make the point that parents are too "child-centered" now. It is true that some parents let their kids have way too much control and give them way more material goods and attention than they need. Kids don't really need much of either. However, what these authors are promoting is extremely opposite of "child-centered." The marketing of products moms "need" is out of control. Many moms waste money on irrelevant products and really need to be aware of the marketing aimed at them to try to get them to buy tons of junk. You need to be smart about marketing, good point. But... then.... the authors make a comment like this: "While it was certainly true that many mothers were looking for toys that were stimulating and compensated for the fact that America still had no national day care or nursery school system, the toy industry always suggested that the new marketing trends were entirely driven by mothers." That's right, it's the lack of national day care that is causing me to become rampantly materialistic! No matter what the problem, these authors will find someone/something to blame it on. Now, to all the other things that I did not like about this book (where to start!): The authors go on and on and on about celebrities and how they are portrayed as perfect mothers and workers. Give me a break. Women have to be smarter than to actually believe this nonsense. Please don't blame People for making you feel guilty as a mother. Celebrities are not even in the same class as the rest of us. They can't even compare their lives to ours. And, if they try, you must know it is a bunch of baloney. If you don't want to read about celebrity babies, don't buy People. Don't watch ET. It's really not hard to avoid if it affects you so much. Although the authors think pointing to a few isolated daycare incidents is no evidence of problems with childcare (they vehemently defend daycares, even ones that are investigated for crimes against children), they seem eager to make a point that a few other isolated cases- Andrea Yates, Susan Smith, babies in dumpsters- is obviously calling attention to a problem with the new "momism." This is the scapegoat for these women who killed their children. No matter what your parenting problem, the authors have an excuse for you! "Dumb Men, Stupid Choices- Or Why We Have No Childcare:" The authors open with a description of a WWII daycare center. The few that were actually like this were open 24 hours and did your laundry and grocery shopping while you worked, along with meal prep, and taking care of sick children in a special place in the center (which were no doubt this nice because they were a temporary solution for women called from home to do their civic duty). The authors are saying this is what it should be like today...... So then the authors go on to bash everyone who doesn't agree with their childcare position. Then they bring out this stat: "By 1995, 75 percent of kids under five were regularly watched by someone other than their parents." They are implying that 75% of women out there need/want government daycare centers. First of all, that statistic is ridiculous. The 75% stat includes part-time moms (which are about ¬Ω of the 75%). Some of these moms work very few hours, other do "split shifts" with their spouse so their children don't have to go to daycare. Many part-time kids are playing with grandma or auntie and cousins. I really doubt these kids would rather be in big, govt. daycare. Now, of the roughly 37% of moms working full-time, the percentage that have to work to make ends meet is very small. If you also look at the preferences of poor women who have to work, they overwhelmingly like home based and relative care for their children-not huge govt. daycare. They also overwhelmingly, if given a choice, would rather stay home and raise their own children. So, the authors of this book are pushing for a childcare system, of enormous cost, that is the least popular option and will serve a minority of working mothers. Then this comment, "Many young mothers who need a salary-and, frankly, time away from the kids-feel they have no choice but to quit their jobs, either for the sake of the kids, or because they simply can't afford the childcare near them." Are these authors suggesting that the taxpayers pick up the bill for moms who want to get out of the house and work for fun? It sure sounds like it! The authors act like there are no honest women out there who enjoy motherhood. The authors are clearly blinded by their own feelings. I'm really not sure why women like these authors feel a calling to publish books trying to convince the public that happy, fulfilled mothers are a "myth." It's not. In the chapter: "Dr. Laura's Neighborhood" (and in the rest of this book) we learn that if you are a: man, home-schooling mom (except a few minority who the authors think are OK), attachment parenting mom, Christian, conservative, someone who likes organically grown food, happy mother, a member of the "Greatest Generation," someone who likes decorating, pro-life, breastfeeding mom, mother of multiple babies (they especially like to attack you if you used fertility drugs) or a SAHM-you are NOT approved by these authors! These authors are pompous and arrogant, thinking they are the be-all-end-all to judge others. These women are clearly driven by some irrational rage against all other mothers who are not exactly like them. The women who wrote this book are the type that will sneer at you in Traget because your child is crying or having a tantrum. They are the types who would turn the other way and let the door slam in your face when you are trying to get your stroller out an non-automatic door. And watch out if you are on their "most hated" list because you would get the extra-extra dirty look. This book reads like a nasty note you would find on the floor of a high school, written by a girl who is jealous of the girls in another clique.
4	4	Thomas Paine's &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;

A lot of the stories I read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had.

0	0	The reason I don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the Western Highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for Maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. This is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the Western Highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in Iraq and Africa and tries to raise them in Scotland. What this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. Today this is illegal "pet" trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. I know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (Durrell, Heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild
1	1	I am a great fan of Saylor's historical novels, but was very disappointed by this one. His skill has always been in creating completely believable environments, down to the smallest details, and placing his stories within those frameworks. But the vast scope of this novel(?) makes that kind of meticulous detail impossible. Everything, including the prose, in this book seems somehow pale and uninspired-- a writer biting off more than he can chew, or, to vary the image, spreading himself way too thin. The book reminds me of James Michener's old pot-boiler, "The Source." Saylor at his best is one-hundred times the writer Michener was, but I enjoyed Michener's book more than Saylor's, which I simply could not finish. Nothing about it engaged me

4	4	Maggie Balistreri's critique of our masked, substantively evasive dialect offers humorous, albeit troubling, insight into how much of the social fabric, the prevailing belief structures and cultural processes, are entrenched in mass denial, subsisting on and predicated upon the avoidance of truth and meaning within common, everday conversations and exchanges. Think of it as speaking in riddles. Unfortunately, it's done considerable damage in shaping the broader public discourse. This particular deficiency is widely adhered to on an unconscious level, to the extent that it's accepted as 'normal'. Let's suppose that the majority of a population shared a common mental illness, a soul sickness; isn't it possible, even likely, that over time, a greater percentage of them would be unable to acknowledge the disease ...*as a disease?* And by that postulation, wouldn't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick, weird, bad, wrong, etc? With people generally unaware of this process(and likely uninterested in it)they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient, or at least insufficient, mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception, mass deception, and in turn, self and societal censorship. This elaborate process largely stems from the "Just Do It" corporatized mentality. The underlying, strategic message of "Just Do It" is DON'T THINK. That is, don't think beyond the superficialities of life: of a mindless, wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism, and all it entails to define human worth and "success" on such terms. When people don't think beyond those terms, when the customary, daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities, often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy, fear, anxiety, the result is an unthinking, non critical, homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought, genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged, enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis. Logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency, its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are, allowing for a delusional, happy consciousness. Language reflects this. My take on what Maggie is addressing in her book isn't a random social trend, and that there isn't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person's overall intelligence or vocabulary; it's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous, corporatized values. The proof is how corporate power, which is basically the hierarchy of government, so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity. The greater the degree of ignorance, apathy, and general disharmony, the greater profits to be made from human misery, and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified, perpetuating the cycle. The psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so. If they're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import(something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite)than naturally, the people's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset.

4	4	17 years later and many things have changed. The desire of investors to accurately gauge the stability of the companies in their portfolios remains the same. The incentive of management with stock options to hide the true nature of what the reality of what the company's earnings have been remains strong. Some of the techniques mentioned will be hard to use when companies employ SPEs to hide their true indebtedness and derivative positions mask the Value at Risk. However, many of the technique still have value. The analysis of receivables and inventories can provide insight into the immediate future of the company. The techniques that have lost their clear edge are the debt and write-off analysis. Write-offs are now required by GAAP (although the "big bath" write-offs are still "non-recurring") and SPEs or variable interest entities can obscure debt. It is fascinating in light of Enron, WorldCom, Qwest, Tyco, and Adelphia the stories of companies in the 70s and 80s that were attempting to do the same thing (though often without the fraud). How little man changes through the ages
3	3	Lincoln Rhyme, detective extraordinaire and forensics expert, is hot on the trail of a chinese human smuggler/terrorist nicknamed The Ghost. A couple of the illegal immigrants being shipped to the US have escaped, are in hiding, and are being hunted down by The Ghost. The combined forces of the NYPD, FBI, as well as the INS must stop him before all of immigrants are taken out. Jeffery Deaver excels here and one can almost perceive the inspiration of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Sonny Li, an undercover cop from China, is the most outstanding character in the book. Since most detective thrillers are generic, it's good to come across splendid work like this. Lincoln Rhyme fans obviously will enjoy The Stone Monkey, but initiates will also be thrilled by it
1	1	I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered. I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should. If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there.
1	1	Although the author does a very good job putting the text of the plays into the modern English vernacular, I feel as though the works have had their flavor removed. If you are a purist, like I am, stick to the "old" translation.
1	1	This book is analagous to buying a new elliptical, anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you, only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life. The author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments, but he is so caught up in the technical details that "the transformation of our consciousness" is brushed aside as an afterthought. Instead, the author drones on and on and on about monuments, angles, precessions, measurements etc. It's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come, but this book never builds on that foundation. There were brief moments when I thought the book started to get really interesting, but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical, newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled, "who gives a [...]." John Major Jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject, and if you don't believe me, I quote page 239 of this book..."as a reminder, my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on Earth." My question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it's hardly mentioned in the book? You would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus, since after all, it's what most of us should be most concerned with. If you are preparing for a test in astronomy, this book is for you. 2 stars for the misleading title.

4	4	Written by Frank Miller and hauntingly illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, YEAR ONE was serialized in Batman #404-407. It tells of the first calendar year in which Batman emerged in Gotham City, beginning with Bruce Wayne returning to Gotham after studying martial arts abroad. Wayne becomes a vigilante, at first without the Batman outfit, at first fumbling a bit. The sequence in which he conceives of the outfit takes the old clich√© from Batman history of a bat crashing through the window and transforms it into a moving moment; YEAR ONE gives similar treatment to flashbacks showing the murder of Wayne's parents. In a city dominated by gangsters before the ascent of insane costumed criminals, Batman encounters Catwoman, here depicted as a whore who takes to the street with frustrations about gender, her sadomasochistic elements heightened. James Gordon becomes a fully-realized character for the first time, adjusting from his move from Chicago to Gotham, where the police force is dominated by corruption. He investigates Batman, suspects Wayne, has an affair, and ultimately has his child kidnapped and rescued by the vigilante he sought to bring down. In a tough city, he goes from crusader against Batman to the first stages of his relationship with Batman. A masterful work, BATMAN: YEAR ONE possesses a level of realism greater than perhaps any Batman tale and, with a breakneck pace, does the hard work of describing the humble beginnings of Batman's career, performing in the process a remarkable process of infusing Bruce Wayne, James Gordon, and Selina Kyle with true character, personality, and history. This is the second best Batman story ever made, second only (perhaps) to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. -- Julian Darius, Sequart.com (for sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels
4	4	Alex Cross is back, and this time he's after The Butcher, the man who killed Alex's wife some ten years ago and has been raping and killing ever since. This character, The Butcher, is one of the more colorful in Cross' bag of collared criminals, and much of the book is spent in The Butcher's POV, which adds texture and depth to this novel. Alex and his near-constant depression can be boring at times, when he's fretting over Nana's workload, how little time he spends with his kids, whether he could have done more to stop the murder of Maria, his wife, some ten years ago. But Alex gets out of his funk long enough to track down The Butcher, and this is a chase I enjoyed. Whether or not Alex will get bored in private practice and will go back to the FBI is a story line that didn't move me, so I'm hoping he decides to go back, but Patterson has another hit with CROSS, and this series just keeps going. For that, I am thankful
1	1	This was required reading for my son going into fifth grade. He is not a strong reader, and neither he nor I enjoyed it. The combination of a large amount of flowery language and very little action made it a struggle to get through. What little humor there was, was too sophisticated. It was hard for us to identify with this foppish married mouse who ate caviar and champagne. While I can appreciate that many (I guess most!) find it literary and delicious, my son found it boring, and looking at it through his eyes, I have to agree
3	3	I finished Kaplan's Ends of the Earth today. I liked the book. Kaplan has consistently been one of my favorite authors (Atlantic Monthly) His theme is consistent: many nation states are not really nation states. I felt that his comments about Iran were especially poignant, given how some view Iran as part of the "Axis of Evil". I get the sense that when this book was written, Kaplan had great hope for the future of Iran as they struggle with theocracy. Ecocide, or the killing of natural resources is a new topic for me that Kaplan introduces. According to Kaplan, many developing nations have traded immediate benefits for the long term health of their natural resources. His observations are very very interesting, especially his observations from the post-Soviet nations like Uzbekistan. Kaplan is a bold, imaginative and thoughtful writer, he is not merely another journalist or another travel writer. His message, right or wrong, is sincere and based on his own personal observations. I highly recommend this work for anyone interested on new perspectives in current affairs.
0	0	I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing. This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand. The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate. The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being

4	4	One of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of Americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them. The feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as "patriarchal, anti-woman" and "sexist." The irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent. As always, the opinions of males are discounted, and whatever words men write are deemed compromised, so let us be grateful that Carrie Lukas came along. She is an equity feminist in the mold of Christina Hoff Sommers and Daphne Patai, and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the Green Berets are to terrorists. Lukas's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men. Her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist, and there's no reason to label them as good or evil. Viva la difference should be the order of every day. By the end, you'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged, and fictional, patriarchy. Lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether. You'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence, that divorce is beneficial to women, and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to "have it all." The real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women. Behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes. The only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness. On aggregate, Lukas's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind. In my opinion, she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I suspect few women will read it. My guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them. What those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself, and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination.
3	3	"The Vietnam Plays, Volume Two," by David Rabe, contains two plays: "Streamers" and "The Orphan," together with a 1992 afterword by the author. The book includes production information on both plays. "Streamers" was produced and staged in 1976, and "The Orphan" was first produced professionally in 1973. "Streamers" looks at a group of Army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to Vietnam while the war is going on. Rabe focuses on a group of three roommates, all junior soldiers. As these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play, Rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference: race, sexual orientation, educational background, rank. Early on in the play Rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds. Also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans. "Streamers" is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life, but I found it to be a dense and complex text, rich in irony, that rewards careful reading. It's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension, lust, anxiety, anger, and violence. Particularly piercing is Rabe's look at the intersection of verbal "violence" and physical violence. I found "The Orphan" far less interesting than its companion piece. In it Rabe melds ancient Greek lore with late-20th century American concerns. Although the play has some strong moments, overall I felt it lacked effectiveness. I felt that Rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the Trojan and Vietnam wars to shed light on each other. Nevertheless, the presence of "Streamers" in this volume makes the book well worth owning, especially for those with an interest in the literature of war. Recommended companion text for "Streamers": "A Sense of Honor," a novel by James Webb
4	4	This great work by Phil Yancey was the Christian book of the year in the 70's, and has lasted the test of time. This is easily the best book on the subject of pain and suffering that I have read; it's teachings are on the mark and scriptural. Yancey nails it when he writes that the suffering in this world is a democracy; that we are all part of it, we all suffer, and we all can help. He makes some fine points considering all areas of the subject. He clearly balances the sovereignty of God and His will with our blessings as His children and our works. He hits on sowing and reaping, as well as the fact that just like Job, sometimes bad things happen to us not as a direct result of anything we did. What I like best is Yancey dives right in, going to Leper colonies and interviewing with people who have suffered life-time dehabilitating injuries. It's interesting to see how they've coped and how they view God, and how their suffering has changed their personal relationship with God. Indeed suffering is universal, yet there is no universal answer behind the causes of it or how to deal with it. I've heard pastors preach that people have died because they smoked cigarrettes, or got a sexually transmitted disease because of permiscuous sex. But the question begs to be asked, what about those who did those things and didn't die? Is it different for a Christian as opposed to a non-Christian? What man on this earth walks close enough with God to have the power to decide what sin resulted in what judgment? If earthquakes are a judgment from God,... are headaches a judgment from God too? And it's certainly an issue that none of us should be pompous about. One reviewer gave this book a one-star rating, saying that "God gives suffering when believers desecrate his house." This is a type of religious crap that this book dispells. Isn't it true that none of us are righteous; even our righteous acts are like filthy rags to the Lord? Then are we categorizing sin by saying that homosexuality can destroy a nation, but the hateful attitude of a right-wing pastor cannot? If Christians who tithe are to be blessed by God, then why have some 'tithers' went bankrupt, while some athiests (and Christian false-teachers) become million-aires? Did 9/11 happen because of the liberal and homosexual communities, as said Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson? Or did it in fact happen because W and the family have gotten in bed financially with Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations, none of which give a rats a__ about America, and even profited from 9/11 when America spent billions on weapons and defense programs..... run by Saudis. Only a true biblical view of the causes and lessons of suffering can help our walk with God to be more fruitful. You'll find no faith/health/prosperity quick fixes in this one. You'll also find nobody on this earth who knows all the answers. This book definitely gives power to that journey with Jesus Christ, however. Just wondering.... a reviewer of this book has declared a "Chinese victory over the USA", and that China is a 'more Christian nation'. Woa, dude. They must have better drugs in China too, apparently
1	1	I purchased this book thinking that it would have good ways to make my boring room look a bit interesting, but I, as a thirteen-year-old, wasn't impressed with the ideas in the book. Condratitory to what the author says, the projects were NOT fun, NOT cheap, NOT for a teen audience, NOT interesting, and NOT a good addition to your room whatsoever. The four themes in this book, which include flowers, teddy bears, funky, and nature, all look as if they were made for the ten-and-under age group. I mean, seriously, what teen devotes their whole room to TEDDY BEARS and decorate every inch with the strange projects in this book? The ideas for the projects are unoriginal, strange, and lame. For example, some of the ideas suggests that you splatter your bedroom wall with multi-colored paints, make a scrunchie holder out of a recycled soda bottle, put a headboard behind your bed that says "I Love Teddy Bears," and so on. Yeah, I know, it's stupid and immature. So if you want a GOOD book that will give you some GOOD room decorating project ideas, definitely stay clear of this one!

1	1	I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist
0	0	i ordered this book to give me some ideas and decorating tips, what i got are pictures of old flea market items, that have nothing to do with each other. didn't help a bit, and truthfully if it didn't cost so much to return, i'd return it in a second
4	4	Louis' Uncle McAllister lives in Scotland and every year sends Louis the best birthday present. And this year was no different, a tadpole, Louis names Alphonse. But it soon becomes apparent that Alphonse is not your normal, everyday tadpole and definitely not turning into a frog. He soon outgrows his jar, then the kitchen sink, and bathtub. Louis sneaks him into the school swimming pool during summer vacation, and that works out just fine until fall when school opens. In a panic Louis consults Miss Seevers, the librarian. Librarians always have all the answers, and Miss Seevers doesn't let him down. With a phone call to Scotland, a little research, and a lot of ingenuity, Louis and Miss Severs find a clever solution and happily-ever-after ending to their problem..... First published twenty-five years ago, Steven Kellogg's creative classic, The Mysterious Tadpole, is as fresh and entertaining today as it was back in 1977. Mr Kellogg has given his new illustrations a bold and bright facelift, and tweaked the text a bit, but the engaging and fun-filled story with its hilarious twist at the end, is still sure to capture the imagination and warm your heart. Perfect for youngsters 3-7, The Mysterious Tadpole is a timeless treasure to share with friends and family now, and future generations in the years to come
0	0	This book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating...well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle. Read "The Fat Fallacy" instead, it provides much more practical information
1	1	Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises
0	0	Simply disastrous work by Pohl. After throroughly enjoying the original Gateway, I was looking forward to this sequel. My hopes were utterly shattered. In summary, here is why this book was totally unreadable. 1. The main characters, Stan and Estrella, are totally unbelievable. Their dialogue is only slightly above kindergarten level. They are never given any motivation for their actions. 2. Pohl fills the pages with useless details, including information about plantlife, and cooking, as well as vomitting and bowel movements. I gave up on the book completely when he decided to indulge in an entire page about one man going to the toilet. Maybe he was trying to be funny. It didn't work. 3. Total lack of plot development. The book is basically a loosely connected series of random events, stuffed with filler. Mid-way through the book Pohl begins to introduce entirely new characters in an attempt to generate some kind of plot momemntum. I have never read a more unfocussed science fiction novel. It comes off as really poorly done space-opera. 4. Characters are completely flat. Stan and Estrella are both sickeningly dumb. Every other character is the exact same cardboard cutout. Aliens act just like humans except they talk funny. It is very cheesy and lacks any attempt at originality. 5. Book has an insane number of sex scenes, and they are all badly written. I mean literally, you cannt go more than 15 pages without a sex scene. So juvenile. I would go on, but I believe my point is made. This book has not a single redeeming feature. If you enjoyed Gateway, DO NOT ruin your memory of it by reading this sequel.
1	1	Cut and Dry.. Iowa's Cousin Rick Black is by far the leader with us deer hunters and how we cook our harvest. I got a copy of 301 Venison Recipes from my uncle. I asked him why he was tossing it out? His reply? "Heck boy, I got The Deer Burger Cookbook and the Venison Cookbook by Cousin Rick Black"! Yepper! Like everyone else. "We will stick with Rick" and his Deer Burger Cookbook and Bag Em and Tag Em
4	4	I have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the BEST book for interviews. The information I have learned from this book applies to almost ANY interview not just the police one. I found that I had already begun categorizing people so I knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business. I am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview. I feel EXTREMELY prepared for the interview thanks to this book
1	1	I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this. Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN. It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am." I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable. I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware. Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible
1	1	Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to "dumb" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time
4	4	*disclaimer: I am writing this as a philosopher of mind so any parts of the book or chapters not related to this are not what I am addressing.* I do not mean to say that Bennett and Hacker have all the answers, but their "ordinary language" approach, along with their debt to Wittgenstein, Ryle, Kenny and Strawson, says something about their book. Most contemporary philosophers of mind (Sprague, Strawson and Hacker, among others, excluded) have rightly dismissed the soul, but have decided that there is something "mysterious" about consciousness, or perception or emotion, or what have you. In response, Bennett and Hacker have shown what "consciousness" really is: the conscious acts of people existing in the world. This is why we know that other people are conscious actors: they do conscious things such as watch birds, or play chess, or eat ham sandwiches. If Michael Tye's or David Chalmers' or Colin McGinn's problems of consiousness (e.g. that I can know that you feel the same pain that I feel, or that you see the same color that I see) are indeed problems for you, you should read this book; if it doesn't prove to you that they are not problems at all, at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions
1	1	My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity. I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist. Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions. Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me.
4	4	Russel Middlebrook is pretty sure that he's gay. After all, he's not attracted to girls, and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half-naked guys in the locker room. He's never had an actual experience with another guy, though, so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he'll outgrow--or maybe not. While surfing the Internet one night, he finds chat rooms for different towns and cities, where you can talk to other people who are also gay. And amazingly enough, there's a boy he meets with the name GayTeen-- who not only lives in his town, but also attends his high school. Another gay boy, in his very own school? There's no way that could be true-- especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle GayTeen is none other than Kevin Land, star of the baseball team, one of the most popular guys in school. As Kevin and Russel get to know one another, outside of school and hidden away from prying eyes, they realize that there's no way for them to be together inside school walls. The same is true for Russel's friends Min and Terese, who although they claim to just be really close friends, are actually in love. So along with a few others, including Gunnar, who is straight, and Brian Bund, the loser of Goodkind High School, the boys form The Geography Club. After all, no one else is going to want to join such a boring club--especially if they knew it was just a front for a gay/ lesbian school group. As events at school heat up, with Brian eventually being outed as gay even though he's not, Russel, Kevin, and their friends will have to learn what's most important in life. And that sometimes, no matter how much you might wish for things to be out in the open, you're just not ready. GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a great, quick read from author Brent Hartinger, about the ups and downs of daily high school life, and the struggle to find ones identity

4	4	I love this book! It plays, quite successfully, with Douglas Adams's idea/question of what happens to gods when people stop believing in them? If you like this book you will also enjoy "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" by Douglas Adams and "American Gods" by Pratchett's friend Neil Gaimen (though this one is darker and gritty - exploring some of the less flattering parts of America). "Good Omens" by Pratchett and Gaimen is a comedy about the end of the world. If you like the first three books I listed here you will like that one too.
4	4	Dolores did a great at job interviewing Phil in her studies, I found myself realizing that it all makes sense. The historcal gaps in history seemed to be filled with his recounts of earths of civilization thousands of years ago. Not a typical abduction case , but a true eye opener. I related to many things in the book and feel that so much has been confirmed with me. I can't wait for a follow-up with Phil. Personally I Can't wait to read it again
4	4	The book is simply superb!! The use of those magnificent photos to enhance the story was the crowning glory to a story that I not only believe, but experience in my own spirit. It is time for the glorious feminine to rise again and, hopefully, repair the damage done to humanity by the mutated females - men. Lois C. Web
1	1	My main interest in reading the book was for the information about the Nazi fascination with the Occult. I was hoping for something as stimulating as Mel Gordon's HANUSSEN: HITLER'S JEWISH CLAIRVOYANT. I was greatly disappointed. Christopher Hale's HIMMLER'S CRUSADE doesn't really deliver what it promises. Hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult, asserts that only Himmler took such notions seriously (but was indulged by those seeking favors from him) and then moves on to other matters. The book draws no real conclusion other than "Nazis were evil," which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book. (I think I knew that before I even started reading the book.) Hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling. For a while it seems as though the book is about Schaeffer, who led the expedition, then toward the end, it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition (and the people with whom THEY interacted). The author goes off on lots of tangents, giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story. After having invested several weeks in reading the book, I am not sure what the point of it was. The most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in Tibet, but the trip to Tibet actually takes up only about half the book. The rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of Nazism. It seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility. The author, Christopher Hale, is a British TV documentarist. This book is an appendix to his TV show. I found it very difficult reading. In addition to its lack of focus, I just don't think Hale is very comfortable with the printed word. There are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage. Perhaps his TV show was interesting, but the book was a chore to read. In addition, the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative, apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence. Several times throughout the book, the author, a Briton, makes outlandish parallels between America and Nazi Germany, which he doesn't bother to back up (because he can't). Perhaps one can get away with this in a TV documentary, but not in a book, where the reader can back up and say, "Wait a minute. That's a bunch of crap. Where is the evidence are you basing that statement on?" The book is also rife with typographical errors (some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example "role" is spelled "roll") and misusages of words. It appears to have not been edited at all. I give this book one and a half stars, but let's round it off to two just for the research the author has done. (His bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book.) I just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting
4	4	This book goes behind the scenes of the professional and amateur world of organized chess. It is very entertaining because not many people (even die hard chess players themselves) have experiences of this nature in the realm of chess politics. The man has done it all and it was fun to read about his spectacular path! Mr. Schultz' love for chess is clear and his accounts of his chess past are entertaining. He tells of the good and he tells of the bad and a lot of humorous little anecdotes in between. If you play chess with any seriousness, this book is certainly an educational tool in terms of understanding how the big organizations like FIDE and USCF operate. However, this book is very suitable for non-chessplayers as well in that there is no actual chess positions or analysis. It is a story of a man's chess life and political career and I found it to be well done
0	0	I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this. I just don't get it. The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.
4	4	This is a very well designed book for an art teacher with small children. It gives lots of ideas for art projects
0	0	The book is full of useless fillings. Finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations. It also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin. After reading the book, I still don't know what my colors are. Besides, with so many different color hues on the market, how can one tell if what you're buying is an ever green or true green for example, confusing. The lack of pictures showing the types of collars they're recommending for different body types (e.g Mandarin collar,cowl,bardot...)...is annoying,to say the least. Questionnaires are poorly structured, & the section on makeup, underwear & accessories is trivial. Save your money (i'm glad the book I read was a borrow from the library) and save your time. Pass
3	3	You can argue all you want about qualifications of Mr. Cherniske. But I will say that my daily caffiene intake was from 600-1100mg a day for years, I quit cold turkey about a month before I started reading the book...and the withdrawal was incredible....headaches, shakes, irritable beyond belief. You can't say this isn't an additive drug while you're slugging down four or more startbucks coffees a day. For months and months I've had hard a time sleeping, waking up in the morning feeling like I have no energy at all. Within two weeks of quitting caffien, I feel great. I still go to bed at 11:30-midnight and get up the same time at 5:45am, yet in the morning I can now get up without any problems and I'm awake the whole day without fatigue, feeling more energized. I CHANGED NOTHING ELSE IN MY DIET OR ROUTINE. I still eat the same stuff as before and have not started exorcizing, or most of all...have taken NONE of the suggested suppliments in the book. The only thing I did was stop drinking coffee/coke and started drinking more water. So save yourself a few bucks if you don't want to buy the book, but do yourself a favor and cut out caffiene. The withdrawal sucks, but it doesn't last for ever. If anything once you get through it, it will give you reason to stay away from caffeine. Da
3	3	Just remember "A man a plan a canal Panama" reads front to back and back to front Great book by a great author.
4	4	At first blush, the Everard family doesn't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors. Hugh, drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency, is in love with his brother John's wife. John, a general in the army in France, does not make an appearance, but his sons Nick and David do. Nick is feckless and irresponsible, just one step ahead of being drummed out of the Royal Navy himself, while David is more professional if somewhat dull. That in the course of the book, one's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character's past layer by layer, like peeling an onion. The criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing. Yes, the book is choppy and yes, it is hard to follow the course of the action. One's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix, but then you realize that this is the whole point. Fullerton's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the Battle of Jutland felt to those who were there. Jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events. Fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time. But you can't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative, just as even Lord Jellicoe wasn't able to do so. For that, you need to consult another book (I would recommend Rules of the Game by Andrew Gordon, which is not only the finest description of the battle, but one of the finest works of military history), but do it after you read this book, so that you get the full flavor of the writer's intent. Very few writers capture the fog of war as well as Fullerton does
4	4	Got this when it came out and gave it a read. Three years have passed and I just referred to it to support writing a paper on technology. The details are good and the higher level dialogue do a nice job of getting the message across without belaboring anything. If you are about the web and doing business, this is worth the bucks and time
0	0	I enjoyed the movie Claire of the Moon, but when I read the book I found it to be a bit sophomoric. I am not a fan of "cookie cutter" type novels and She Walks in Beauty would definately fall into that catagory in my opinion. Even if I had mounds of free time I would not spend much of it on this book, it's an extreme let down.
4	4	After reading Kingston's &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; I thought I'd read &quot;China Men.&quot; I am not disapointed at all. &quot;China Men&quot; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of Chinese men in America from the 1840s to the Vietnam War. Although Kingston uses as much Chinese myth in this book as she does in &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; she apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated. Even so, Kingston's stories and the way in which she recounts them is absolutely splendid
3	3	Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985, this thoughtful character novel focuses on Macon Leary, a travel writer who hates to travel, a man who has gone through life observing what is happening, but who has never been truly engaged. Compulsively tidy, Macon has always believed that it is possible to order one's life so effectively that the untidiness, or chaos, that throws life into confusion can be avoided. And then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time. It gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes Macon and his wife, and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin. When the novel opens, Macon and Sarah have decided to separate, with Sarah getting her own apartment (where she can be as messy as she wants) and Macon remaining in the house with his son Ethan's undisciplined dog Edward. In fact, Macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house, to recuperate from his physical wounds--an accident in which he breaks his leg-- and from his emotional wounds. Then into his life comes Muriel, a divorcee with an over-protected, allergic, and hypersensitive son. She is a dog trainer, a flake, the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive, sometimes vicious "pet" that lives with Macon. As Macon tries to deal with his life, his loss of Sarah (who is dating), his son's dog (which attacks anything that moves), and his commitment to producing yet another travel book, his life becomes more complicated, and the depth of his relationship with Sarah, relative to the shared loss they have faced, becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which Muriel offers. Filled with wonderful descriptions of life, both within Macon's family and in Europe, where he travels for research, the novel provides the reader with a full, realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been, in part, the result of their commitment to their son. Poignant and emotional, but avoiding melodrama, the novel explores the meaning of life and love, the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved, and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time. n Mary Whipple
3	3	The late Dr. F.F. Bruce was a well respected biblical scholar and his commentaries and books have greatly benefited the Church of Christ. It is no different than with this work on the Book of Acts. This book falls in line with the rest of the New International Commentary on the New Testament edited by Gordon Fee. The NIC is a solid evangelical commentary on the New Testament with the differing opinions stated in the works (see Revelation for example). Dr. Bruce has gone to great lengths to point out the differences among evangelicals in Acts. The commentary itself is full of Greek word studies, historical and geographical points, maps, and solid exegesis of every passage in Acts. My only drawback with this work on Acts as well as the other works of the NICNT is that they are not laid out in expository outlines. It would be helpful if every section was given an expository outline to help the reader when moving through the sections of the Scriptures that the authors are working through. For a better expository outline see the commentaries of John MacArthur or John Phillips
3	3	In an inventive, imaginative plot, John Dunning successfully combines elements from 20th century literary and film history into a tale of deceit and psychological manipulation. Each of the players in this intricate plot of murder is lying - but about who, about what? Cliff Janeway tackles the conundrum in his usual style - intelligent, canny, suspicious, and sometimes over-emotional - and nearly comes to grief himself. What makes him such an appealing kind of guy is his need to act on his principles, regardless of risk. An intriguing backstory, twisty subplot, and surprise ending make Sign of the Book another page-turner
4	4	What can I say? Nora Roberts did it again in Angels Fall. I whipped through this book in record time again, then passed it on to a buddy (who also loved it). Her books just get better and better as she goes along
4	4	this book is short and brief (100 pages or so), that is its intended appeal. it is not and does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of all theological and philosophical thought-- just a very thoughtful and broad view of the impact of thought, art, industry, etcetera and its culmination on the state of our current society. to this end the book is fullfilling
3	3	When I first started reading this book, the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly. Soon, though, I realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject (censorship) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across. The story is told in letters, predominantly between 19-yo cousins Tassie and Ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents, neighbors and the Nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero's statue (Nollop, inventor of the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."--of note because it contains every letter of the English alphabet). The idea that a government, especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the English language as this one, would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects. First, like sheep being led to slaughter and, later, taking charge of their own destinies. I found Ella Minnow Pea a very quick and enjoyable read. It is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about. If you are a fan of language, you will likely enjoy it. It is rare that I come across a book that has a word in it with which I am not familiar; this book contained MANY words unfamiliar to me--a truly impressive level of vocabulary (though some words were, I think, coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters). I recommend this book--especially for those who, like I, are concerned about the direction OUR society is taking in terms of censorship
1	1	Daniel B. Clendenin's EASTERN ORTHODOXY CHRISTIAN: A Western Perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of Christianity to Protestants. An evangelical Protestant, Clendenin became acquainted with Eastern Orthodoxy while teaching at Moscow State University. He is convinced that Protestants and Orthodox have much to learn from each other, and that Protestants should approach the East with a "hermeneutic of love". The work is divided into seven sections. The first is a general introduction and the second a brief history. The next four sections each deal with an aspect of Orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to Protestants. These are the emphasis on apophatic revelation, the use of icons, the relationship of Scripture and Tradition, and theosis. In the final section Clendenin critiques Orthodoxy from his Protestant perspective--dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in Orthodox churches--but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities. Clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics, however. I was not too impressed by the book. Much of the work is repetitive, and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed. Clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the Church. He writes, for example, that the Slavs were converted in 988, when this marked only the conversion of Kyiv Rus and most Slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier. His focus is entirely on the church in Russia and Greece/Byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored. The work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes, suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand. For Westerners curious about Orthodoxy, I think there is no better introduction than Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition. Clendenin's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between Protestants and Orthodox, but his work is really too short
3	3	A vitamin every six minutes ranks up there with Voltaire's 50 cups of coffee a day. Such monomania would seem frivolous were the stakes not so high. Ray is simply a Baby Boomer limping along better than most, until he catches the singularity train of (relative) immortality, which should be along real soon now. Except for the occasional howler--alkaline water comes to mind--the book offers sensible advice, though he should have included a chapter on how to raise the money to pay for all the tests, vitamins, supplements, and psychiatrists
1	1	The puzzles are great and a lot of fun for my two-year old. She loves anything 'princessy' so the princesses were a big selling point. However, after she did each puzzle a couple of times, the pieces didn't stay in the book. When we'd flip the page, all the pieces from that page would fall out. We ended up taking all the pieces out and putting them in a container, which is not the point of the book at all! At least the backs of the pieces are colored specifically for one puzzle in the book, and my daughter gets practice at sorting her colors for half an hour before we can play with her puzzles.
0	0	There is no doubt that Sun Tzu's little book on war is an enduring classic, but this little edition is ridiculous. There is a reason it is so cheap. It is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction. If you are going to take the trouble to buy and read Sun Tzu's masterpiece, you should at least get a version that explains what Sun Tzu was really talking about. The best translation is by Giles, as is this, but in the original Giles translation there is a running commentary, between the lines by Giles and several classical Chinese scholars, explaining both the context and meaning of the text. It is virtually impossible to really appreciate what Sun Tzu was talking about without the background that the original Giles translation provides. There are several editions of the full Giles edition available. Any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version. The best is the Special Edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version, like this edition, in addition to the Chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for
1	1	This book was very shallow and too general. Didn't go in depth at all.
0	0	I am certainly agreed with &quot; a reader from San Francisco&quot;. I have almost all of Lilian Too's Feng Shui Books and a recently bought her EoFS. I have found her recent publications are nothing, but just a repetition of her previous books. Certainly a great disappointment from a master! Please Lilian don't published just for the sake of publishing
0	0	Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now. Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book. More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult. The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere. The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing. I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time. I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.
0	0	Possibly the worst book I have ever read. The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader. The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code. Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant. If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk. Now open the book at random and read aloud. This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.
4	4	I originially bought this book because I am a fan of McSorley's and wanted to learn a little about New York History. I had no previous knowledge of Joseph Mitchell's works, and did not know what to expect. I wondered how someone could write a 350 page book about when bar. Then i soon realized that the book is a compilation of short stories about the characters of the city in the 30's and 40's. Primary source history usually bores me, because it is often dry, about someone consequential, and you have to read through alot for a little interesting information. But the way Mitchell presents these characters you are drawn in into their plight,eccentricities, or just regular routines. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the city, or if you are a fan of the bar and are just curious like mysel
4	4	This book was such a relief because it covered classroom discipline, from the beginning, without talking down to the reader. The chapters are organized so that you can implement the methods right away, in a useful sequence without becoming overwhelmed. You need to read this book if you fear you are a pushover in the classroom. I have used these methods in a multicultural classroom with more than half of my students as non-native English speakers. It really works! There is a tremendous feeling of respect between everyone in the classroom. I was especially pleased with the effect on one of my students who was severely abused as a child and who grew up very untrusting in foster homes, etc. In September, he was violent with himself and with other children, striking classroom objects or people when he was angry. Other teachers are amazed at how much he has changed since the beginning of the school year. I owe so much to the advice in this book
0	0	I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting. I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good

0	0	I would refer anyone who would take this author seriously to James Randi's comments on his behavior. He represents the modern version of the crystal ball reader and his claims should be eyed with an appropriate degree of skepticism. This would be a benign phenomenon but that his success depends on the suspension of reasoned thought on the part of those who grieve for their lost loved ones
4	4	STan really did keep and care for James and his family, including when JAmes briefly returned to Ireland to establish an art cinema chain leaving his family in ITaly. Excellent insight into the brilliant writer by his also brilliant brother. Please read this book for greater understanding and afection for the specifics of Joyce's work (how stan was pictured in the story A Painful Case), although the view of the universal themes grows dim as we can no longer see the woods for the trees Essential to any complete James JOyce bookshelf and a wonderful and grateful gift for any member of the fervent Joycean faith
0	0	Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D
0	0	Nothing new in this book and CD does not add to the value of this purchase. I purchased the book and CD combination in hopes of having experiential exercises. Exercises are provided, yet the author merely explains these on the CD versus guiding one through a meditation. It feels as if he is merely reading the directions for the exercises and the exercises are not new or imaginative. If one is new to self help books on healing trauma or anxiety, this may be the book for you. I've read and heard authors and psychologists talk about the flight and fight response over 20 years ago. I, personally, have found more healing/success in spiritual books, guided meditations or intense physical exercise where my heart rate increases or in strength training.
0	0	What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel. The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog. When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about. It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy. I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book. This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement. She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing." Obviously not a person who knows me well. Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing. I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless
0	0	I'm glad that I got this book out from the library instead of buying it. It provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup, and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they're straight from the 80's. I really don't know anyone who wears scarves, overalls, or blouses to school. The language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated. I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and "beauty diversity", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls. The author herself was a Miss Teen Claifornia finalist, so I suppose one couln't expect much more. I would avoid buying this for a young girl, or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl
4	4	Witnesses to Freedom focuses on the efforts and dedication of young African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. The stories of protesters as young as nine years old are narrated as well as told through the eyes of the young freedom fighters. This book highlights not only the more famous young activists that students may not have exposure to, but many young people who did both big and small things to help make the movement. For example, the book opens with a story about Barbara Johns, a teenager who led a movement in her school to boycott for better educational facilities and resources. The book also tells the stories of more famous teenagers like Elizabeth Eckford who integrated Little Rock's all white Central High, and Claudette Colvin who was arrested for not giving up her seat to a white person on a Montgomery bus months before Rosa Park's famous arrest. While the book highlights specific individuals, the stories place a strong emphasis on the importance of group participation for social change. Each young activist was working to inspire others to join the cause, and make the movement truly powerful. Photographs are also included of the young activists which adds a personal touch to their stories of struggle and survival. This book would be an excellent book to introduce students to the struggle and inspire them to want to learn more about the history of African-Americans. The emphasis on the power of young people to make social change makes this book an excellent resource for children. This book would be best suited for older children ages 11 and 12. The book is written in a more mature format, and covers more mature subject matter
4	4	This great little book is full of easy juicing recipes. Another good thing about this book is that Jay goes into detail about the vast, enormous benefits of a raw foods vegan diet. I am not a raw foodist, but as a vegan it is wonderful that Jay informs people who buy this book who may not be Vegan the simple fact that one can easily get calcium from other sources than cows milk. I have had a juicer for two years and still refer back to this book from time to time

4	4	K.M. Soehnlein did not strike a single false note for me in his coming-of-age novel. The non-linear nature of many conversations (which still communicate much to both the listeners AND the speakers), the guilt and excitement that a person feels when he continues to experience life during tragic circumstances, the way a series of bold decisions suddenly add up to a life spinning wildly out of control: all of these ring true to me. The protagonist Robin McKenzie is destined for greater things than his suburban New Jersey town can give him -- he's smart, creative, and hungry -- but we're lucky to have a peak into the half-year when his life and identity are transformed (unfortunately, by an accident when childhood teasing gets out-of-hand). The book is written for adults, although older teenagers might be ready for it. I imagine that some high school gays will dog-ear certain hot sections for re-reading. I would have done so had I stumbled on such a book when I was in high school. Wait, I did ... **SPOILER** And for once in recent fiction, a gay relationship in high school is shown to be the intoxicating, confusing, educational and FINITE experience that it often is. I look forward to reading more from K.M. Soehnlein

1	1	I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life. I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money. This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE. It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect. If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you. Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level. Save your money and speak with a career counsler

1	1	While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them. Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates. If you're looking for this type of book, I strongly recommend &quot;Women on Top&quot;
1	1	If you are familiar with modular knitting, this book offers nothing new. The patterns didn't appeal to me at all; there was no snap to the designs. If you aren't familiar with modular knitting, there are better books from which to learn
1	1	It's taken me a while to get through this book partly because I'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. There are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. The author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. I'm contemplating the latter
1	1	Robert Allen is one of the many real estate "gurus" in the world who probably makes more money selling you the "secrets" to real estate then actually practicing his own advice. I have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it. I am guessing those who love his stuff haven't actually tried to do it. The book has a lot of wealth building ideas, but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully, which is not the typical reader of his books. He is looking for the person who needs to find the "magic bullet" for easy wealth and success, but unfortunately you won't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book. What you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work, money, and experience you actually need to be successful. He spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing, which is where he got his start, but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard, takes a lot of time, and requires experience. You will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales, marketing, construction, and general business. Some of the actual investing ideas are ok, but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work, which will exclude a lof of people. He also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while I know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information. Overall his ideas are average, but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work. If you can take any of ONE of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work, knowledge learned, and experience you must earn. It will not be as easy as Mr. Allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests. If you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you won't get much more from it.
0	0	ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.
1	1	Here's the scoop: The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added. That's only part of the problem. David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice. If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort. Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part. Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention. However, her parts are very small. I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem
4	4	I borrowed a copy of its second edition a few days ago and have just finish it. I just love this book. I wish that I would have a chance to read this book a few years ago.
0	0	I bought this book thinking that it might be more than the usual time line history that so many other writers have produced. I was bitterly disappointed. Nothing new to add to the history of the band and really quite a bland read. As someone who knows that there was more to the 'lads' than what has been previously written, I was expecting more insight into their lives, more accurate information, and basically just MORE. The title of the book is quite misleading, as the only Babylon that seemed to go on was Tam's alledged chasing of Pat around hotel rooms and one recalled incident of Les and a mate hiding 2 groupies on a freezing balcony. If you know anything about the Rollers, you don't need to buy this book in hopes of learning more. It simply isn't there. A huge disappointment for this long time Roller fan.
4	4	Some books are optional. "The Worm Ouroboros", by E. R. Eddison, is not. It is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it. It is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply don't do. When you read "The Worm Ouroboros" you'll realize that modern writers produce stories, but they don't tell Stories. Since the English language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review, I'll just have to present samples of Eddison's writing: "But a great wonder of this chamber, and a marvel to behold, was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone, carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster: here was a harpy with a screaming mouth, so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her: here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake: there a cockatrice made of a single ruby: there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight, cut for a cyclops, so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye: leviathans, all hewn from faultless gems, thrice the bulk of a big man's body, velvet-dark sapphires, crystolite, beryl, amethyst, and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold." (7) Everyone can write description, but only Eddison could write description like this. He makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the "monsters" stick out in your mind. And even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like, you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph. Eddison realized that you can't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times. "Now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills, and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days' space in the Zia valley, above the gorges. Here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre, and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side. High in the south , couched above great gray moraines, the Zia glacier, wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos, thrusts his snout into the valley. Here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders, casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather. The air blows sharp from the glacier, and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight." (153) Perhaps it's because I'm a mountain-climber myself, but I found Juss and Brandoch Daha's assault on Koshtra Pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters. In real life no two mountain ranges are alike, yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains. Eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers, feel the biting cold winds, and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes, he needs to give his mountains some real personality. These samples, of course, only scratch the surface of Eddison's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor; he maintains this level, never flagging, for all two hundred thousand words. But of course "The Worm Ouroboros" could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing. On one side King Gorice XII of Witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will. Opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of Demonland, lead by the magnificent Lord Juss and his family. The ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea, across continents and mountain ranges. And without any doubt Eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration: "La Fireez," said Juss, "we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee. Yet must I hold my course; having sworn a strong oath that I would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until I had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage. So sware I or ever went that ill journey to Carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered. Nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination. But when that is done, no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of Pixyland, and many good things besides to be a token of our love." Said the Prince, "Thou doest right. If thou didst other thou'dst have my blame." "And mine thereto," said Gaslark. "Do not I grieve, think'st thou, to see the Princess Armelline, my sweet young cousin, grow every day more wan o' the cheek and pale? And all for sorrow and teen for her own true love, the Lord Goldry Bluszco. And she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire, thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately. I deem to-day better than to-morrow, and to-morrow better than his morrow, to set sail for wide-fronted Impland." (315) One of the most commonly used review terms is larger than life. "The Worm Ouroboros" is larger than larger than life. Indeed, after finishing you may wonder whether it would be more appropriate to refer to real life as "smaller than Eddison"
1	1	I certainly agree that Portis is a talented writer, but I just didn't find him all that funny. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange. I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited. I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel

4	4	I give this memoir five stars for the the author's curiousity, acumen and intelligence, all of which inform this wide-ranging tale. Eating My Words will answer your questions about Mimi Sheraton's adventures as a New York Times food critic, travel writer and magazine editor, as well as stints spent as consultant to venues ranging from the famed Four Seasons restaurant to public schools and hospital kitchens. Through it all, Sheraton reveals a keen intellect, a dedication to research, and a passion for accuracy. Her prose is direct rather than lyrical, but the reader will emerge with a better understanding of restaurants and both admiration and appreciation for a woman and writer who has lived her life well. Especially worthy savoring are Sheraton's love for her husband, Richard Falcone-- their marriage of 49 years gives a happy backdrop to this memoir, and Sheraton's reminiscences of her parents, who imbue her with wit, chutzpah, and lifelong curiousity about all things culinary. Also welcome are Sheraton's observations about the workplace: "It's not your job, the employer has rented it to you," she observes, noting that if the job no longer suits you, it is time to quit-- something that Sheraton did several times in her career, including her departure from the New York Times. My appreciation for Sheraton and this book grew as I progressed through the narrative. My initial four star appraisal had grown to five my the end of this memoir, chiefly because of my admiration for Sheraton and her well-lived life. This is a woman who has lived with zest and integrity aned, thankfully, has chosen to share her experiences with us. We should all be so lucky
1	1	I bought this book for myself, expecting to find some useful advice to help me organize my day a little better and to stay focused on priorities. I have been in management for 12 years and I expected this book to offer some new insights into time management and other daily challenges. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and struggled to find some useful advice within the first half and have since put it down. The book seems to target a junior audience with a certain type of personality that is more focused on fitting in and accommodating others, rather than those focused on leadership and results. The book itself feels really cheap. I is printed on that cheap news-print paper like those crossword puzzle books.
1	1	Mark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America. Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it. Did they actually read it? This book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways. I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever. This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas. The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument. Not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US. He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument.
3	3	Easy to read, understand, and put into practice. Common sense, practical advice. Similar content as his "Being Zen" book
4	4	This is an enjoyable book that gives one pause to think about the words one reads in novels. Written by an English Prof; it gives insight into the meaning of words; especially as the are used in books
4	4	I asked for this book because I thought it would give advice on how to raise daughters--it does--and more. Dr. Northrup begins by explaining how mothers and daughters are connected through the generations, and how we can only create a healthy relationship with our daughter when we heal our relationship with our mother. As we heal ourselves, we heal all the women who have gone on before us. This is only a sample of some of the insight she offers into our relationships as women. I'll admit I was surprised by the holistic approach she takes, but am glad she offers that insight, as I'm only vaguely familiar with some of the ideas/theories and believe I have more to grow in that area. Rather than a book geared towards raising children (I've read my share--and I thought that's what this book would be) I would categorize this book as a self-help book geared toward strengthening and creating a healthy relationship with your mother and daughter. Very pleased with everything I've read
1	1	Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book. Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility. The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution
1	1	What exactly is positive about the Koran and its view of women? Every single assertion of this polemic is either a complete fabrication or wrong. The Hadiths and Sunna are not the chauvinistic part 'corrupting' the Koran, if anything the opposite is true. In Surah 4:34 the Koran orders the Husband to beat his wife. In numerous Suras the husband is ordered to pay the equivalent of a dowry to his wife, not her family however. The entire Koranic book of 'women' is simply one law after another about 'them' which is to say the women. The reason it is talking about 'them' when referring to women and 'us' when speaking about men is because the Koran is meant for men. There is not one equality in the entire Koran dealing with women and men. Men may take four wives women, women presumably one husband. Men may have slaves and men may marry and do as they please sexually with the slaves. No similar injunction applies for women. Men receive virgins and wine and service in heaven...the situation of women in heaven is left to the imagination, although presumably they make up the virgins. The Koran details a world of only men where women are not only chattel but are the sexual objects of the society, sold as slaves and used and then divorced at the mans pleasure. There is not one equality. Scholars have argued that Koran reformed women's rights and elevated their status because in pre-Islamic Arabia women had NO rights and under Koran they are entitled to at least a dowry and a man may not take endless numbers of wives. This doesn't translate as equality, it translates as a male centered world, where men are masters and women are virtually property. The fact that god in Koran is not referred to as 'father' does not indicate a feminist view of god but merely reflects the very monotheistic nature of Islam, certainly a valid fact that differentiates it from Christianity. However once again this is not evidence of women's rights, because the non-gender view of god doesn't change the very negative view of women's role on earth given in the Koran. If someone is going to read this they should certainly have handy an unbiased translation of the Koran so they can reflect on all the laws regarding women and why those same laws do not apply equally to men, for instance one might wonder why a wife may not beat her disobeying husband? Or why the husband is not commanded to be modest? Seth J. Frantzman
4	4	Great book, easy to read. Lots of information about different hair types and braiding tips. Step-by-step instruction on braiding techniques and braiding styles for all age groups and ethnic backgrounds. If you're into hair cosmetology this is a must have.
1	1	More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV. Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats
3	3	The best parts of The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece, by Jonathan Harr, deal with the artist himself. When most artists are considered eccentric, Caravaggio was a renegade in his actions. A fighter. He killed a man, and lived his last years on the run. Many of his paintings were initially discounted, but his popularity grew in later years. I enjoyed the book, and found the idea of these lost masterpieces, valued in the tens of millions of dollars, to be out there somewhere very fascinating. Four stars & recommended.
4	4	Judith Butler's study of Antigone, over the course of these 3 lectures, yields important and timely insights about how we might understand kinship and love in today's society. Her analysis of Hegel, Levi-Strauss, and Lacan is impressively rigorous. A must read for anyone interested in liguistics, structuralism, feminism and contemporary questions about political belonging.
4	4	i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story, years ago. at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start. finally, i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long, it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going. its an amazing book and has become one of my favorite
4	4	Even a few years after it's release, Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies... not a purveyor of good food--or nutritious food for that matter. For many years, food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry, but not these things are starting to surface. The book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to "make" the foods served at these restaurants. It opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process. I've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all, probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food. Since this book came out, there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before. Reports including additives, trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it's act. This doesn't mean that fast food is good for you, it just means that Schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that wasn't challenged as strongly as it should have been. I personally haven't had fast food for over 5 years, but--even that far removed--as I was reading this I felt sick to my stomach. Read this book and you'll never step foot in McDonalds again.

1	1	This is simply a rehash of Dr. Burns previous writings. If you have read Feeling Good, it is a waste of money to purchase this book. He covers the same material but change the names the scenerios. He is a one trick pony and clearly has done no more recent research , since the prior books
1	1	The other reviewers will tell you about the book. I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read. What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism. I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published. I guess most people will sell their souls for money. Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments). The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men. The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters. This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women. So this is just a warning. If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.
4	4	I read this one for the first time in 1959, a year after it was published. This story has never left me. For some reasone it left quite an impression. Recently I ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it, took it home and read it again. I now know why it has stayed with me all these year! It is good! I have, over the years read quite a number of Heinlein's works and I must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch. I realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader, but, as I just found out, it is quite a nice read for the older reader also. As I remember, looking back, this book rather inspired me in many ways, and doing better in school was by no means the least. Some of Heinlein's later work was rather difficult for me to digest, i.e. I simply did not like them. I rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one. Recommend this one highly.
1	1	The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, "barriers to entry" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain "Competition Demystified" With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book "A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy ". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say "The end of competition". Kindly recall "The end of history..." The book however deserves praise for use of Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy. Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms. Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish.
1	1	I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one. I just liked it. It was okay. Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors. I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them. However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story. I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story. Very disappointed.
0	0	I think the book is very flippant and uninformative. If you are looking for hard facts, skip this one. I'd like to return it for a refund and I'd be embarrased to pass it on
4	4	Sheldon Stern has presented a harrowing study of one of the most dangerous events in World History - The Cuban Missile Crisis. In his book, The Week the World Stood Still: Inside the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis, we are presented with an event whose story line reads like it was written by a Robert Ludlum-like mystery writer, this story, however, was frighteningly true history. With the careful, thoughtful, and thorough research that is Mr. Stern's trademark, the reader is presented with the complete inside story of that fateful week. This is a must read for, not only students, but adults as well. Kudos
0	0	Although this electronic atlas has all the Netter plates, and quite a few nice new ones, as well as some radiographic views, it is nearly unusable in practice. The images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible. The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation). Part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar, so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640. If you estimate a typical plate to be 10&quot; x 10&quot;, that works out to maybe 50 dpi. Many of the smaller features on the original art cannot be seen on tne electronic version, and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going. The quality does not change when you print or zoom in. All the other bells and whistles, like the study lists, searching, etc. just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful. And the user interface is terribly archaic, nonstandard, and hard to use. The font for the lables is horrible. Also, I'm not sure I like the pronunciation of the speaking feature: &quot;pec-tor-AY-lis major&quot;? If you have the cash to spare, it makes a nice toy, but it is not worth the price

0	1	Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of "people, profits, and planet" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well. It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking? At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet. There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money. There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business. Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that. Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new
1	4	First, my background: I am not a mathematician, but an academic with fair knowledge of college math and even some advanced materials. I do greatly enjoy reading books about mathematics and mathematicians. This book is obviously a work of great effort by the author. My difficulty probably came from the work's ambitious premise: offering mathematical and biographical history of Hilbert's problems. There are simply too many ideas and persons (some well known, others a bit obscure to lay reader like myself) to cover in one book. The author dutifully and honestly gives references to his sources. My impression is that the author collected as much material as he could about each problem and solvers, and tried to squeeze the information as compactly as possible into the pages. The result: the narrative is very methodically told - explanation of the problem, some necessary ideas introduced, who the major solvers were, then a short biography of each solver, when and where they were born, who their parents were, where they went to school, who they married and so on; then another cycle begins. Halfway into the book, I began to get bored. I can imagine mathematicians enjoying a quick review of and glimpses into their discipline and heroes, but lay readers much beware. I recommend lay readers to check out a few pages carefully online or at your local library to see whether you like it. I certainly didn't hate it but did not like it as much as I expected
0	1	Save your money and leave this book on the shelf. This guide to summer programs is disorganized and unclear. Moreover, most of the information is duplicated in its heftier sibling, Peterson's &quot;Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers&quot;

4	4	Gingerbread Baby is a twist on the traditional story of "The Gingerbread Boy." Matti and his mother follow the recipe to bake a gingerbread boy, but when Matti opens the oven too early a gingerbread baby jumps out instead. As the gingerbread boy does in the original story, the gingerbread baby runs away and is chased through the town by the townspeople and animals. However, in this version, instead of the Gingerbread Baby being eaten by a fox, Matti stays home baking a gingerbread house for the Gingerbread Baby to run into. Children will enjoy lifting the flap on the last page and seeing the Gingerbread Baby inside his house. This book would be appropriate for children ages 5 through 8. Children in this age group enjoy hearing make-believe stories involving talking animals or toys or, in this case, talking cookies! I think young children especially will be happy that in this version the Gingerbread Baby does not get eaten by the fox in the end. I recommend sharing this story with children for enjoyment at Christmastime. Jan Brett's illustrations are beautiful and cover every inch of the page. The authenticity of the drawings of the Swiss village and the townspeople is stunning. Each image is drawn with exquisite detail. The illustrated borders on each page, which give the appearance of being made out of cookie dough and icing, picture additional scenes related to the events unfolding in the story inside Gingerbread Baby shaped cutouts. The eye-catching endpapers round out the beauty of the book as a whole.
4	4	Sir George is a parsimonious, mean-spirited man who cares more about his cat Samson than he does his three daughters. The cat, a mean old Tom who scratches everyone except for Sir George has been missing for two days putting his master in a fouler mood than usual. Sir George wakes up quickly when he hears Samson outside and goes to find him. Someone smashes him on his head killing him. Since Sir George was the cousin of Queen Victoria, his case is very high profile so Scotland Yard assigns it to Inspector Gerald Witherspoon who has a phenomenal successor rate in solving homicides. Neither Witherspoon nor his supervisors know that his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the other servants of his house work behind the scenes to help their master solve his cases. This inquiry is harder than most as everyone has a motive for killing the baronet, including his three daughters, his ex-lover, the gardener the housekeeper, and trades people he cheated out of money. This is one historical mystery series that never gets boring or dull. The author keeps the series fresh by making each homicide case original. Lovers of late Victorian mysteries will thoroughly enjoy this tale because Inspector Witherspoon comes across as so innocent and na√Øve that readers will adore him. Emily Brightwell is an author whose mysteries are well worth reading. Harriet Klausner
0	4	What trash! What a paranoid book! A true work of tendentious and speculative fiction disguised as an essay. No wonder that Amazon stands ready to sell this book for $0.35! Even then, it's a quarter and a half wasted. No wonder also that warmongers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle gave it a note of thanks. It reads like their own propaganda in their conspiracy to take over American foreign policy and steer it to Israel's favor. But the Mylroie-Wolfowitz-Perle cabal DID succeed in having the U.S. attack Iraq. This only shows the tremendous importance of propaganda and the strength of the pro-Israel lobby. Nazi Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's minister of propaganda, would be proud of Laurie Mylroie, since he once said: "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it."
4	4	if your interested in a healthy diet, of any type, this book is a MUST. for those already or considering vegetarianism, i have not yet found anything that compares. this book focuses on the "How to be healthy" and leaves preaching (in things one may or may not agree with) aside, so it is an awesome source for everyone. omnivores and veggie/vegans (health, AR, environmentalist or any mix) will feel comfortable reading and reaping the benefits from this book. in depth but easy to understand explanations of basic dietary needs, info from many studies, and how to make the most of this info in one's everyday eating habits. it takes time to explain the macronutrients (to include protein requirements and essential amino acid intake), individual minerals and vitamins, essential fatty acids and more. a book that i'm extremely pleased to have come across and to have in my library
4	4	I had never heard of The Borowitz Report until a couple of days ago, when a girl in my dorm showed me this book. I opened it up to a random page and saw the headline "Bush May Lack Gene For Human Speech." I started giggling as I read the piece and by the end of it I was laughing hysterically. This happened again and again as I flipped through the book until I realized I was laughing out loud on every page. No book has ever made me done that before. (As for my TV viewing habits, I am a huge fan of The Daily Show and this book is right up there with it.) The book is based on a daily e-newsletter called The Borowitz Report which I have now signed up to receive every day. If the guy can manage to write columns each day that are as funny as the ones in this book, I don't know how he does it. This book is at the very top of my list of recommendations. You won't be sorry you got it
1	1	This book is divided into chapters with different religio-social related themes such as "God", "money", "Power", "Love" etc. For each theme, the author presents a few movies relating to it. It didn't take long to realize that Higgins is a liberal Christian who seems more concerned with political ideologies than the salvation of souls. The values promoted are Christian to a degree but only those that overlap with modern liberalism. Higgins got annoying fast by constantly criticizing the Church (which I think he means Evangelical Christians) though he doesn't name names. And the reason for the criticism is that they don't uphold the 'true message' of Christianity which is that even more annoying buzz word 'social justice' and liberal ethics in general. Higgins uses the typical method of judging the 'Church' for judging other's behaviors as sinful. The subtitle "Finding Spiritual Fingerprints in Culturally Significant Films" itself is somewhat disturbing. The movie industry is the last place we should hope to find much true spirituality. It is overridden with everything contrary to Christianity. Saying that some of these movies have the fingerprints of God (I know he doesn't actually say that, but its implied) is to overlook the other prevalent messages in these movies that are ungodly to the core. Even a small amount of arsenic in a glass of water is deadly. So even though I do watch movies, I am very cautious to see much holiness in them. For as much as I didn't like the book, it did introduce me to some new movies which I have now watched and enjoyed.
1	4	Although the book was extremely detailed and thorough, it made me realize that it is impossible to prepare for this exam from this book alone.
3	4	Out of the despair of a young woman needing guidance and affirmation for her existence, MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT is born. Melda Beaty longed for the type of love that tells a young girl she has worth, beauty and unlimited potential. For a male love that is disconnected from possession, obsession or penetration; love that only a father can give. Never knowing that magnitude of love, she harbored ill feelings for her father. Traumatized since she was a little girl, her nightmares ended only after she became a woman with a legitimate voice, and truly forgave her father. Since her atonement, Ms. Beaty has been blessed to meet and share stories with other Black women with similar histories of overwhelming father-daughter relationships. Relationships that more often than not, define how we relate to the men in our lives. MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRT speaks of the totality of our lives as black women and the full spectrum of kinship with our fathers. MY SOUL TO HIS SPIRIT does not bash fathers, however, it does present a penetrating view from every possible angle. The six powerful chapters, Loving: Daddy's Girl; Distant: Every Once in Awhile; Abandon: One Day He Was Gone; Non-Existent: Could Pass Me on the Street; Amended: Time and Forgiveness Heals All Wounds; and Deceased: Gone Too Soon, cover the gamut of emotions daughters have felt for fathers. I applaud Ms. Beaty and all the daughters who contributed to this book of healing and strengthening for the family unit. I venture to say each reader will be familiar with at least one of the offerings. This is a humbling read; an epiphany. Reviewed by aNN of The RAWSISTAZ¬ô Reviewers
4	4	As David Catrow tells us in his introduction, "...For me, the Constitution is a kind of how-to book, showing us ways to have happiness, safety, and comfort...", and he uses his immeasurable talents as an artist and cartoonist to teach an inspirational and unforgettable lesson that is sure to open interesting discussions at home and school. Following a glossary of what the actual words in the Preamble of the Constitution mean, (e.g. "IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION: To come together and make things better for everyone who lives in our country. INSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY: To make sure we can all have a nice life and get along with one another. TO OURSELVES AND OUR POSTERITY: For kids, parents, other grown-ups, and all the people born in our country after we are."), Mr Catrow details the meaning of these important ideals, phrase by phrase, using his marvelously bold and busy cartoon illustrations. Each two page spread is a clever feast for the eyes, rich in engaging details, manic energy, and droll humor. Perfect for youngsters 8-12, We The Kids is a witty and memorable treasure, and one of the real winners of 2002 that shouldn't be missed
4	4	If you don't know much about ancient Greek history or culture, this is the best short book I know of. On every page, in every sentence, the author gets straight to the point, with no fancy obfuscations, assuming no prior knowledge. I've never seen a better organized history of ancient Greece. Besides that, I strongly approve of the map selection and the timelines. He gives just enough depth to be a solid introduction--just a little bit more than "what you're supposed to know." Some teachers I know prefer a book titled "Ancient Greece" written by a team of authors led by Sarah Pomeroy. It has just a bit more depth than this book, but it isn't nearly as well written. It seems that they wanted it to be easily comprehensible, but I'm not sure they succeeded. It does have the advantage of a little more depth, but if you're reading for pleasure, I recommend this one rather than that one. It is, though, only an introduction; that's the obvious downside of being short. You might want more information about the culture: more excerpts from the poets, the thoughts of the philosophers described in more detail, more plates (or plates in color) about the art. Actually the book is amply illustrated in black and white. But of course a book dedicated to Greek culture would have better information on any of these aspects, and that would be a book worth reading. This one serves only as an introduction. I strongly recommend reading the Norton Critical Editions of the Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod, a couple famous tragedies (in my opinion, Euripides' Medea is the one to read first), and a few of Plato's more famous dialogues. THAT is an introduction; but if that's the kind of thing you intend to do, this book will be a great place to start. On the historical/political/social matters, this book is again a great introduction, but only an introduction. If you want more detailed information, especially a look at the reasons historians believe such and such happened, I very strongly recommend John V. A. Fine's "The Ancient Greeks," one of the very best history books I've ever read. Of course it's a lot longer, but it's worth it. Once again, if you're reading for pleasure, I recommend this one first, and then Fine's book, which is a bit harder to follow. If you want to read about Greek religion, I would once again start here; but then you should read the classic, Walter Burkert's book, and follow it up with Jan Bremmer's book, both titled "Greek Religion." Of course, why not a little cheerleading for learning about ancient Greece? Since the Renaissance and even more since the Victorian era, anyone in the West who would call themselves educated has had to have basic knowledge of ancient Greece. They were certainly very influential on Western culture, and via Bactria even had some considerable influence on East Asia. I've found that Greek history somehow arouses more curiousity in students than modern European or American history. I think it's because of the nature of the ancient Greeks themselves, because they reflected on human nature via their own history, so as we study ancient Greece, we get to reflect on the nature of power, why governments take forms such as aristocracies or democracies or monarchies, why wars are won or lost, why empires rise and fall, how much blood and misery flow through history, and so on. Students don't merely have to memorize lists of events and prepared ideas, but they get to reflect about life, why the world is the way it is, for themselves. And that is what most people, young or old, are all about.
0	1	Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago. The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture". If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)

4	4	This book is excellent for anyone who is tracking their food intake, whether you're on a diet to loose weight or a special diet for health reasons. This book tells you everything you need to know about individual foods/entrees whether you buy from a grocery store or are eating out! Surprising details that help you make informed decisions about what you eat
4	4	I found &quot;Leadership presence&quot; to be very inspiring not only for leaders and managers but for every human being engaged in the business of life! As a teacher, mother and grand-mother, I am using some of the skills offered in the book with my students and family and finding them more than useful: profound. This book is not just another &quot;how to&quot; book, it comes from deeper waters of presence and compassion. Plus it is fun to read, full of great stories. A gem
0	1	The story-line is OK, even though some unlikely coincidences occur. BUT, the writing is very amateurish and full of grammatical, punctuation, and syntax errors (among others). It was like slogging through quicksand to read it. The book must have been self-published because no editor would have let it go out with all the errors. A very good editor could make this an OK book, though not nearly the quality of Susan Kay's. Don't buy it unless you are a Phantom of the Opera collector and just must have everything published
3	3	A lot of character exploration in this collection. A lot of the X-Men being the young people they are have started to couple up. There are also some breaks with Colossus and Nightcrawler having problems after Colossus has come out. The major storyling is the Phoenix. Is Jean Grey the Phoenix? I can't say without spoiling it, but it does not follow the path of the traditional Marvel Universe. Overall it was a good story, the artwork is a but uneven at times, but it works for the most part
0	1	When I read stuff on the back of this novel like, "preposterously brilliant", "a classic comic novel", and "Amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best", I immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of "masterpiece" or "this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for. The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know. All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor. P.S. If you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by "a reader"; probably the same dude

4	4	&quot;'Introduction to Fall Protection' by J. Nigel Ellis, is a masterpiece in the art and practices for fall protection. Excellent resource packed with useful information. The great value in this book is that it simplifies an otherwise tough subject! It will, no doubt, save many lives. How much more worth could you get than that?&quot
4	4	Recently, my wife and I went on holiday to the Bordeaux region to tour the vineyards. This book was extremely helpful in planning and executing the trip. As geography and 'terroir' are key to understanding wine, I know of no other book that gives a better overview of this mysterious and elegant beverage. It's a must buy for wine lovers
1	1	Warning spoilers... In the worst installment of a bad series, Fitzchivalry wont die. Perhaps the most interesting plot point of this whole contrived series is wasted entirely. Fitz, who died, and rose again has his potentially interesting ordeal descrobed in perhaps the most boring way possible. I supposed his dead body was infused with both wolf personality and human for a while (I guess souls mix when they are contained in a tiny brain), and of course the seizures. Seizures trouble Fitz for a while, as long as they are convenient to the plot, and then, of course, they totally vanish. While I found it really interesting that Fitz used to be dead, and the ramifications of that, we find that there are no ramifications whatsoever, except for a brief period of eliminate-the-wolf-behavior rehab. I mean, he was reanimated after a period of time, but that's no big deal I guess. Robin Hobb is such a good story teller, but she is horrible at plot. Except in the Liveship traders series, but she must have written that one entirely differently, because you can't tell that this is the same author. What she is good at is writing loveable characters, and slowly feeding you tidbits of knowledge about interesting things as the characters "learn" about them. In other words she can "feed the fire" of the story well to keep interest. But that doesn't mean she does it consistently, and this book is a great example of how even Hobb can utterly fail. Robin relys solely on you LOVING the characters (which I feel she herself does) and she allows that to distract you from reasonable pacing. This book starts out slow, then begins the ending phase of the master plot, and slowly slowly slowly panders through that and then ends in a rush. Not to mention the fact that she knows nothing about plausibility. This whole series is based on a character that is as loveable as your little brother, yet supposedly kills without compunction. You know, an assassin. This series asks people a simple question. How would you describe an assassin? Prior to reading this series you might say ruthless, cold, cruel, at best disaffected and callous. Crafty certainly. After reading this book, you would say, kind, affectionate, and loves dogs? Add to that loyal to himself first, good natured, well liked, and an advisor to royalty? So is Robin Hobb rethinking the role of an assassin? No, you can't do that. An assassin is an assassin. You can't change that FACT. No, she's creating a hero who was trained as an assassin, but who only functions as an assassin very very very few times at all, since that is a nasty business. As kind and good natured as Fitz is, he never once questions the morality of killing someone because he was told in the weighty manner such a question deserves. He never is actually put to any test. So, Robin creates a hero, calls him an assassin, and swings the plot around to have him doing everying imaginable EXCEPT functioning as a cold-hearted killer. He's a spy, a soldier, a telepathy partner, a wolf-buddy, and for some reason everyone just thinks he ought to be the hero. When everything comes together, everyone just says Fitz, be the hero. For no good reason at all (because you have telepathy does that make you the guy to go to?). [...] Perhaps Robin thought the weirdness of the ending scenes would add a sort of tension, and of course, they were being persued, and so I guess that added drama. But of course, the main threat, the "forged ones" were not really a threat anymore, but of course, you still have to resolve that issue, and was neatly done in the end. But I felt the whole story, the drama of the "forged ones" really wasn't so dramatic, and I just don't get what caused them to behave just like they did. On a fantasy scale, it was new, but not very interesting. Robin does much better with dragons in the Liveship traders, and these dragons are just stupid. And Verity-as-dragon is perhaps the dumbest of all. Over all a slow build up for an overall letdown. If I began Robin Hobb with this series, I would have never read her again. I am forcing myself to finish the Tawny man series now, because I WANT to like her stuff. But I don't know if I will EVER find enough time to finish that sleeper series. Overall, try Ship of Magic, unless you are already invested in this, and have to have closure
1	1	I bought this book thinking it would be a more specicfic musculoskeletal companion to Braddom's generalized PM&R textbook. Unfortunately the treatment paragraphs (most important section from my perspective) for each topic were very thin and nonspecific. They were woefully inadequate for an attending or physiatry resident. I sent the book back which unfortunately meant I didn't get to critique the DVD.
0	1	I think we all agree that we would like to be good and moral people and to raise children who are good and moral. I have some problems around Coles' ideas of how to achieve this. He disregards well-researched principles of infant psychology, e.g. that a parent cannot really &quot;spoil&quot; a newborn baby. Nowhere does he refer to the research of people like Bowlby, who have found an association between secure attachment between parent and infant, and psychological health of the child
4	4	Like it or not, we are all on a spiritual path, consciously or unconsciously! Our minds deem it "difficult", but in truth, we are spirits having a human experience, not humans having a spiritual experience. With this in mind, this author's book is a stellar, yet gentle, reminder to get out of our heads, and into our spiritual heritage. Much of what he writes makes me do just that: "Oh yes, I know that, thank you for reminding me yet once again!" So much of this book resounds deeply in my heart. We all need this gentle reminding, no matter what stage we think we've achieved on this journey. This book is written with light-hearted-ness that makes me smile, and pick up it up once again for pick-me-ups.Keener Jansse
1	1	The author made a huge mistake with this one. It is so basic, meaning a lack of pictures and good graphics to lower its cost, that it ends up driving no point home at all. This book is a complete waste of time. The only plus is that it is one of the only true general virology textbooks out there
4	4	i've been going to grouphug.us for years now, it's the best place to go when you need a little pick me up. i have learned that people are truely psycho. that fact alone makes me feel 10x better about the things i've done. when i found out that there was a book published, i had to go buy it right away. i am so glad that i did. this is one of the funniest things i have ever read. i have passed it around to many of my friends, they all agree that it is awesome. it was the best christmas present i have ever found. no matter what people are interested in, they all adore this book. i have three copies of this; one in my bedroom, one on my coffee table, and one in my bathroom. i suggest you buy this book if you want a good laugh or if you want to learn about the bizarre behavior of you neighbors
4	4	I find Chuck Norris's story amazing because no matter what anyone else said he worked towards and achieved his goals. An interesting concept of this is how he always shows respect and a smile on his face to everyone he meets, even people who scower at him. He does this because its a proven fact that if you fight someone's negative attitude with more negativity, nothing will get solved and most likely there will be arguments or maybe even fights. This is one of the many lessons you can learn out of this book, go buy it today. I knew I could learn something out of it and I have learned a lot. I'm glad I bought this book
0	1	I like readable prose. This is more like poetry with meaning that must be disciphered or intuited. I am disappointed and am sending the book back. I bought it on the basis of the first reviewer but it didn't impress me as much. I think it would be better to write rather than read more esoteric writing about writing. I would pass on this one
4	4	I am a huge fan of Laurie Colwin's writing, so I am baffled by the reviewers who didn't enjoy this book as much as I did. To me, her writing is sophisticated yet very comfortable. I can identify most with the main character in this particular book of hers as I also married a bit later in life and am trying to have a child despite being a little long in the tooth. The longings Jane Louise has for the domestic bliss that other people in her life seem to have so easily are all too familiar. This book will not hit you over the head with a message, and it does meander ... which is just like life for most of us. And I for one sometimes enjoy a book that doesn't leave me with a headache. Reading is so much like eating - balancing what's good for you with satisfying cravings for those things that aren't - and for me, Laurie Colwin's books are like hot tea with milk and sugar on a cold afternoon. Grown up, but sweet and comforting - they always hit the spot. And I still find myself in disbelief that there will be no more books by this great writer
4	4	I love this cookbook! The recipes are very authentic and the variety is excellent. I make a recipe from this book at least once a week, and I've had the book for a year. I recently bought a copy for my mother-in-law. I've had people tell me that my food tastes better than something from an Italian restaurant. The recipes do involve a lot of cooking, since most of them use fresh herbs and vegetables. But the quality makes it worth the time! Happy cooking
4	4	This is a book that you'll read over and over. You'll dog ear the pages and turn them yellow with highlighter. There is pure gold to be mined on every page. What makes this book so valuable is the science behind persuasion that Mr. Hogan explains in easy to understand language. You walk away with a real understanding of how to persuade and why it works. In fact, I found the chapter on the impact of non-verbal communication to be worth the whole price of the book and even more. After I read this book, I was surprised it wasn't priced in the $80 range like many of the other persuasion books. This book should be considered a primer for everyone who wants to seriously persuade. Get it, read it, use it, persuade, profit.
0	1	To all who have read this malarkey, and for those who intend to, I have a suggestion. First, read all the articles by Tim Callahan of Skeptic magazine. He is an authentic scholar who specializes in debunking revisionism and bigotry. Since he like Mr. Cahill is Irish the 3-5 star reviewers will not be able to condemn him for being anti-Irish. He makes certain, unlike Cahill that he has a mountain of proof-evidence to verify his thesis. I was so impressed with his methods that it truly surprised me that some people actually fell for this book. In fact he used every point that the 1-2 star reviewers mentioned, and more. I agree with him that the entire "Hinges Of History Series" largely lacks any in depth research. The first 3 chapters of this book is devoted to rehashing what most of us learned in grade school. The next 2 chapters are clearly the authors reinterpretations of the period. The rest of the book felt padded. What does Plato have to do with the title, or premise? Where are the footnotes and sources? That makes everything dubious at best. Also, Cahill did make Archie Bunker type remarks about other groups that have no place in our society, except in a very tasteless jokebook. Read Callahan first, or in place of this rusty fiction.
4	4	This book, of many that I have read, deals most concretely and clearly with the major texts of Judaism. I consider it a must-read for all who are interested in learning more about the often obscure texts and their authors
4	4	Sam Intrator has collected a diverse sampling of stories from teachers of all types. They inspire and inform and are enjoyable to read. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who teaches, from preschool to graduate school
4	4	I am about to begin my first year teaching high school art, and this book has sparked more excitement for the career I have chosen than any other. I expect to return to it again and again when I need a pick-me-up during my upcoming "difficult first year" of teaching - it makes me feel LUCKY to be able to be in the field of education. Any teacher, novice or experienced, would find inspiration in this wonderfully easy to read and engaging book on meaningful teaching
4	4	Higly recommend to read with your toddler-absolutely wonderful illustrations! What a cute story!!!!
1	1	Finders Keepers, by Linnea Sinclair is another scifi/romance. It's an action/adventure story with plenty of romance, but set in a science fiction setting. Captain Elliot and her C-3PO-type droid, named Dezi, find a marooned and unconscious man on a desolate planet. But the rescued man, Rhis, isn't who he claims to be. And Captain Elliot soon finds herself in the middle of conspiracy and treachery. Elliot seems to trust Rhis even though he has lied to her, simply because she's attracted to him. The technical jargon is a bit much, as are Sinclair's made up words and language. This book might have been easier to read (and not as corny), if she had toned down the bizarre language with so many "z's" and "v's." On the other hand, her descriptives regarding appearances were seriously lacking. There was an alien species, but I have no idea what they looked like. And no one else, other than the two main characters, was described in any detail either. Besides my criticisms, there was a good story underneath, though the ending seemed a bit abrupt
4	4	Regardless of some of the negative reviews I found that this book contains some of the best advice you can get about internet marketing. Some have their opinions about his book about "how to get rich by telling other people how to get rich." Although that has some truth to it, there is so much more to it - if you think of how to apply it in your industry or niche! What some of these reviewers fail to understand is that this book gives you the strategies on how to market your particular business effectively through using the internet, NOT just "teaching people how to get rich." And the subtitle to this book accurately says it all, "making money online using e-mail" In my opinion that's what this book is about and is accurately communicated in the title. I highly recommend this book to anybody who wants to start an online business. Although you could get most of the material for free on the internet, it's much more convenient and saves you A LOT of time to have this book around.
0	0	This guide is written in French and is utterly useless to anyone who does not speak French
0	1	I found out that there isn't any difference with Adkins for Life from the first book. Disappointing, I tried both with a group of folks from work and we all have had the same results. However, I never support anything unless I have been convinced it truly does what it says and I found that with "the average joes diet." A friend told me about it and I was always considered the fat girl. No longer! and it's stayed off.
4	4	This is a basic book on Ayurveda, giving a great overview on its basic principles. Anyone intersted on this subject should read it, and it is very suitable for beginners.
1	4	I found this book impossible to use! The photos and illustrations were so detailed, with lines traveling everywhere, that I couldn't transfer what I saw on the page to what I saw on my hand. I was disappointed
3	1	I acutally read the entire book unlike almost all of the people who gave this book a bad rating. Ann Coulter is a Conservative genius. She pokes holes in the liberal agenda like no one else. She is intelligent, and makes very good arguements. The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last chapter was a bit dull. This is some of her earlier writing, and therefore was not the best. She should have put this chapter closer to the beginning, so it wouldn't be the last thing the reader remembers. Other than the last chapter, this book is filled with great humor, while still being informative and making her arguements. She includes some publisher notes from her articles to show that the media does have a liberal bias (even though they say they don't)...this book should be on everyone's must read list!!
4	4	Yes, I have seen Seventh Seal many times, and it is, indeed, stark. The other night I watched the new Criterion DVD I was gifted with the lights out, the sound off and volumes one and two of Coil's 'Music to listen to in the dark' popped in the stereo. I mean, once one has once seen Seventh Seal, there is nothing to the plot. (I won't say that of the dialog because I don't speak Swedish.) It's like Oedipus Rex. This is a Swedish movie. Everyone in it looks Swedish. (Even death). Death is beyond anything from Bill and Ted, yet (without Seventh Seal) would we even have Bill and Ted? I just like to watch these Swedish people talk. Perhaps the longest scene in the movie is shot on a beach, the horizon at mid-screen, and the entire top of the screen contains a horse, stamping, moving about, never still for but a moment. It is imagery that takes your breath away. As an image it is more than I could ever hope for, incomprehensible and compelling. Add Max Van Sydow, and, well, whatever! It's not a movie that you should intend to understand. It's just beauty to watch and think about later. Maybe always
4	4	I've read this book a few times, and it never fails to amuse me with its intricately woven stories, wicked satire, and twisted plots. Perhaps it's not everyone's cup of tea (as other reviews have shown) but I loved the mix of 19th century convoluted plotting (a la Wilkie Collins or Palliser's own Quincunx) and send-ups of modern literary theory, in the form of a literary critic cum cult leader, and such luminaries as Jeffery Archer, seen here as an egotistical politician turned plagarist. I am not a fan of books as puzzles, but this is no postmodern deconstruction of fiction; it's just a funny take on a thematically linked short story collection
3	4	Jonathan Kellerman has been one of my favorite authors for years, particularly the Alex Delaware novels. This - non-Delaware novel - starts slow but delivers in the end. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the slow beginning. I even put it down a time or two thinking I'd never get where he was going, but I'm glad I persisted. It turned out to be very well worth it. This is an old fashioned cerebral murder mystery with our hero and amateur sleuth the psychologist doctor lover of the first victim. Eh? Got the hairs standing up? He is befriended (in an odd circumscribed manner) by an older pathologist who invites him to dinner with friends one evening. As the murders continue our hero begins receiving obscure clues - and he's not sure who to ascribe them to. This is a well plotted, very satisfying read if you can make it through the - sorry - slow beginning. Kellerman reveals a whole new side to his writing abilities in this deeply thoughtful mystery. Loved it!
1	4	This book was a total waste of money for me. The UK English is nearly impossible to decipher at times. It is very difficult reading. This mihgt be a good book for experts but is worthless to the beginner. The author describes repair in detail, but assumes the reader knows all the technical terms being used without explaining them. The drawings are difficult to decipher. Photos would have been better. If you are a beginner looking for a good book to get started in clock repair, this isn't it
4	4	It was very interesting and exciting to delve into the life of a family hiding from the Nazis during WWII. I highly recommend this book and I hope I can one day go see the Anne Frank museum where the family lived during this time
4	4	But the simple drawing technique is also useful. Great if you want to paint or draw expressively. The pictures are inspiring
0	1	If you want to read a Classic of Western Mythology, look no further. This is specious philosophy under the guise of a supposed 'truth' about reality. The tragedy of all this is noticing other reviewers' comments about how the contents of this book negatively influenced their lives. Dawkins belief that we are machines created by our genes is a misleading view of reality, and when evolutionary 'science' catches up with evolutionary 'philosophy,' this view will come out false. This could only be taken seriously by those who are so blinded by the details that they can no longer think straight, so they are not able to figure out where the argument is wrong, let alone realize something IS wrong with it. What almost everyone doesn't seem to understand, even about VALID arguments is this: ALL a valid argument does is set up a tug of war between the premises being true and the conclusion being false. If the conclusion is OUTRAGEOUS, you don't, "bite the bullet," "swallow the medicine," and accept the conclusion anyway. You say there MUST be something wrong with the premises, even if you can't point out where the mistake is. It took some 2,000 years before someone came up with a solution to why Zeno's argument that 'nothing moves' is incorrect. But during that period of time, NO ONE (except maybe a few fools here and there- probably 'intellectuals' like this Dawkins character) accepted the conclusion that nothing moves
4	4	I have read nearly all of Mr. Walsch's books. The CwG series IS the world's wake up call. You must have an open mind to be able to see the true depth of this series. At one time, I used to believe as the naysayers. Then I started to wake up and truely see the illusion, for what it really is. People find that the hardest thing to accept is that what we truely believe in may not have been presented through the generations correctly. People have a hard time accepting that any belief, great or small, may not be totally correct. The closed minded will never see this. The wise and opened mined person will. I highly admire Mr. Walsch for revealing to the world, what he transscribed from his conversations with God. I truely and deeply believe what he has written. I believe because I can now see, for when before I could not. His works are far from rubbish. Most believe the Bible in it's present form must be accepted as is. I submit, where is the version of the Bible before it was ordered to be edited by Emperor Constitine in 325? Do you want the truth? Simply by learning to meditate on a daily basis, will allow everyone see that we are here to recreate ourselves anew in greatest version of the grandest vision of who we really are. ONLY IF you are truly honest with yourself and learn Meditation, you will then believe in these treasured works. I recommend "Spiritual Breakthrough" by John van Auken to learn meditation. It's the how to guide to reach the consciousness of God
0	1	Well, my wife and I tried this diet plan, and lost a little, BUT... CON: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy. CON: It makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant. CON: How do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch? Arrowroot? Pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores. File Gumbo? Makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal. CON: Somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a COMPREHENSIVE index. Facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book. PRO: SHe's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of Atkins, Sugar-busters, and Carb Addicts. PRO: She's easier on the eyes than Atkins was
4	4	This book is great and truly small batch baking. A sweet treat delight without tons of left-overs. Great for the smaller household.
0	3	Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER
1	4	I tried to find specific conditions in the book - and the procedures to follow for treating them. I couldn't even figure out the procedures to follow when reading them - the writing just isn't very clear. If there is any organization to this book, I couldn't detect it. The author is very enthusiastic about the material and gives lots of her experiences with her patients. That's nice, but judicious editing, better organization and clarity is what this book needs.
0	1	This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten. I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read.
4	4	I recently discovered Sugimoto's pictures browsing the web. This book is beautifully produced and plate after plate demands not only an aesthetic response from the viewer but also a decidedly intellectual and conceptual one (maybe that's the same thing!). It's rare to find art that is simultaneously so beautiful and so profound
4	1	Very good commentary on Revelation, from the viewpoint of everything but the Final Judgment occurred in the first century A.D
1	4	I wanted to like this one. I really did. My son loves hand clap games and board books so it seemed like a natural fit. He just seemed to hate the repetition in this one. The sounds/words/rhythm are the same page in and page out and by page 5, he was acting like he does when I try to read a book to him a second time to avoid getting up to get another. (He's seen it before and he knows it.
4	4	P.D. James, aka Phyllis Dorothy James White, has painted the mystery genre with a literary hue which has delighted fans for decades. Her writing is stylish and extremely well-crafted. Her characters are so fully developed that they seem almost like friends the reader delights in meeting again. James' heroine in this book, Cordelia Grey, lacks the long and rich legacy of Adam Dalgliesh - the author's usual sharp-witted and charming P.I., but she does pack a wallop in the two books she appears in. Mature and wise beyond her years - Cordelia is only 22 when we meet her - this heroine knows how to draw us into the murder at hand - in this case the neglected but privileged son of a powerful scientist. Brave and insightful sometimes, scared and confused often, Cordelia soldiers through this mystery from one deduced fact to the next and arrives at a somewhat unusual (for this genre) denoument. I won't tell you what that is but it causes a bemused Adam Dalgliesh to pop up at the end of the book in a half-hearted attempt to break down Cordelia's defenses. Cordelia is an appealing and well-drawn character who only appeared in two of James' novels. She later, mistakenly she says, sold Cordelia, or the rights to her existence anyway, to the BBC, which subsequently did a TV series based on the character. I picked up this book as a dog-eared paperback in a used book store because the title kept popping up in lists of "bests" for this genre - most recently in an essay by Anna Quindlan. I haven't read a mystery in years but found myself really enjoying this one - for the story, the lovable Cordelia, and for the craftsmanship of the author. Recommended
4	4	Born In Blood And Fire is a superbly presented and concise history of Latin America which covers six centuries and twenty countries, linking accounts of individuals, economics, politics and social structure in a uniform, logical progression of events which will delight both general readers and students seeking an introduction to the region's history. Chapters provide many insights on Latin issues in the process of revealing the history of different nations. Born In Blood And Fire is an invaluable introduction and survey for students of Latin American history
4	4	I am in ethereal love with Mary Shelley. Why is her literary importance and fancy not uplifted more than it is? I grimace whenever I go to a bookstore and glance each time at the Mary Shelley section to find only Frakenstein. She has other great books probably not many people know about. Such is the case in The Last Man. I thought Frankenstein was about as sad as one could allow a character to feel but after reading The Last Man Mary out does herself by really putting poor Verney in a pickle. This story really tugged at me hard and actually made me feel for the characters in a way so few books or movies ever have. If you know about Mary Shelley and have read Frankenstein or anything else by this, I feel, greatest author to have ever put word to paper, then you MUST read this beautiful accounting of "the last year of the world". It astonished me to find out that the book was out of print from 1833 to 1965. Wow! I failed to compare the story to such contemporary biological warfare or AIDS for that matter and took the story's meaning for what Shelley may have wanted to get across during her time that had neither. I believe she wants to almost persuade us of a deeper level of human condition and compassion by taking us as low as we can and then allowing us to constantly strive upward from that awful place she leaves Verney. Please, read more of Mary Shelley
3	1	American academic Ido Oren started his research by looking at the common idea that democracies do not fight each other. He shows how studies only support this idea because our concept of democracy is produced by the same historical patterns against which the claims are `tested', a history partly shaped by the USA's international rivalries. So, before World War One, Woodrow Wilson, the political scientist, described Imperial Germany as an advanced constitutional state, a model for administrative reform. Yet when he became President, Woodrow Wilson took the USA into war against Germany, and described it as an autocracy. Oren looks at American political science as an ideology: its claims to uphold the ideals of liberal democracy, as expressed, for instance, by Samuel Huntingdon, a past President of the American Political Science Association. Yet the apartheid government used Huntingdon's writings, as when he backed it against `the worse alternative' of a government led by `the revolutionaries of the ANC'. He advised the apartheid government that increased authoritarianism might be necessary for reform, rationalising its repression, and he backed its `centralization of power'. Typically, the CIA funded some of his research. Oren studies American political science's characterisations of the USA's chief enemies last century, its concomitant characterisations of the USA, and its involvement in the wars against Imperial Germany, Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. "I document a systematic pattern of change in the portrayals of these enemies before and after their conflicts with us." Also, he shows the pattern of concurrence between US wars and transformations in political science's visions of the USA. The Soviet Union was seen as all state, no society, the USA as all society, no state. He chronicles the growth of intimacy between the political science profession and the State Department, especially during the US attack on Vietnam. Oren asks whether `American political science might be more attached to America's regime than to democracy'. He concludes that it indeed works from the US state, not an objective, perspective.
1	4	he gives plenty of stats and fine details but forgets that he's talking about people. it becomes very boring and lifeless, too much emphasis on details and not enough on the players behind the numbers. i recommend &quot; baseball in 41' &quot; by robert creamer, a fine book something that &quot;more than merkle...&quot; should've had more of
3	4	This is really an artful piece of work. Eisner was a revolutionary. He paved the way for stories that were embedded in reality. He really inspired another legend, Frank Miller who produced Daredevil's best run and Sin City. These are some really gripping stories that grasped at my heart strings I felt sorry for the wife of the alley singer, I felt sorry for the rabbi who lost his daughter, etc. Well it seems I just felt sorry for these folks. If you're a comic fan, you love reality represented and you like tan and white (which Eisner said is the color people dream in) then this is the book for you
0	4	My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event!
0	1	I was truly disappointed in this text. While it may be appropriate for military use, I found it difficult to tranport the information and tactics to a civilian environment
4	4	From the first page to the very end, you love this crazy family and especially Rebecca. In this sad and dysfunctional world - to be able to read this book in two days was a wonderful and warm happening! I actually missed the family when I closed this book with tears and a smile - I love them and will keep this book to cherish with my family - always. Thank you Anne Tyler!
4	4	Karen O'Connor's new book is a gem. I found myself laughing out loud, nodding and then relaying her quips and common sense with friends and family. I've always enjoyed Ms. O'Connor's other books, but this is the best yet. It's also a book to share. Buy one for yourself and give 'em as presents &quot;just because.&quot; That's what I'm going to do
0	1	If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you. There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books. Buy any of the others. Avoid this one
4	4	We use this book in service dog dog when some puppies never out grow their aggressiveness. Cick and treat is used in every phase of the dogs learning in school so it was not surprising it was being in healing aggression. It has helped my personal pet,a cocker spaniel, as well as dogs in service dog school as well
4	4	This is a book about a boy named Matt and his adventures. Matt's father goes back to Quincy to get Matt's two sisters and his mom. Matt has to survive in the woods alone. He might even make friends with some unexpected people. I really liked The Sign of the Beaver because it had a good beginning and showed a lot of emotion within the characters. When the author wrote about one part of the book, I thought there was going to be a different ending. I was very surprised about what the ending really was. The author described the book with very interesting words that really explained what the story is about. Matt makes friends with an Indian boy named Attean. Their relationship is complicated. This book is one of the best novels I've ever read. I hope you get a chance to read it
4	4	An exceptional production. Jean Matthews' RISE OF THE NEW WOMAN provides a history of the women's movement in America between 1875-1930. This was the period which brought about fundamental changes in the lives and opportunities of American women: chapters show how women gained access to all levels of education and achievement, and how they struggled against doors still shut to their abilities
0	1	Don't get swindled by the packaging. The graphical quality of the contents are suspect as a fair amount of the illustrations I can only describe as grade school crayon scribbles. There are a few exceptions to the rule, but not enough to warrant purchase
1	1	The notion of drive states is interesting. The description of the particular states is not altogether convincing. Basic criticism: Not much development/content for a book
4	4	I love pop-up books and this one left me hungry for something sweet---Like a cookie. Wonderful pop-ups. Great premis. My Great Grand children loved this boo
0	1	I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
1	1	If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book.
1	1	Michael Seid's extensive experience yields some useful insights and he explains many of the steps involved in franchising, but the book reads too much like advertorial and Seid spends way too much time trumpeting his own accomplishments. (Wendy's founder Dave Thomas' contributions to the book are woefully slim and including him as a coauthor seems to serve more as a marketing tool.) Franchising for Dummies would be a worthwhile addition to your library on the subject, but if you're looking for a single, objective, authoritarian source on the subject, keep looking
0	1	I have to admit, I have forced myself to listen to Michael Weiner's abortion of a talkshow more than once.In a way it's almost humorous, until you stop to think that so many people in this country not only take this man seriously, they view him as a deep political thinker. He is not.He is an ignorant, homophobic, sexist, racist little subhuman troll. An insult to true, honest-to-God old-fashioned American conservatism. William F. Buckley Jr he ain't. What this is the rantings of a deeply psychologically disturbed individual. One would find more insightful comments at your state's mental hospital, or by a survey of several of your town's homeless population. I can't wait for the day when Savage, Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Reilly AND their counterparts on the left Moore, Franken, Janeane Garafolo and the rest are off the air and languishing in the obscurity that they so deserve. Or even better, we could get NASA to get cracking on building the first solar lander, and have them put these windbags on it. The average IQ of the nation would increase, and perhaps we would then be able to listen to REAL political discourse, instead of a bunch of ignorant, partisan loudmouths with an agenda screaming at one another.
4	4	Just follow the 4 phases and you will see amazing results!!!!! I love the fact that after Phase I you willsee results not only on the scale, but in how your clothes fit and actually see a reduction in your physiqu
4	4	I saw the group of eight in concert about a month ago and I was so disappointed to see the performance end. I REALLY enjoyed their poetry and this book just gave me another dose of it. Sometimes you need another dose to fully get into poets, because when Beau Sia came to Northern Michigan University, I didn't care for him. I didn't think he was funny. But when I saw him in Chicago, I cracked up. Poets are funny people. Sometimes they just take some getting used to and some grow on you before they can open their mouth (i.e. Lemon). I'm curious why the ninth poet wasn't on the tour, but atleast I got to read his poetry in this book, which was excellent from beginning to end. My favorite poem is &quot;Love Poem&quot; by Lemon, but the rest are all good in separate styles. All the different techniques and language are what make this group so entertaining. Keep up the great work! I was advertising for them coming to Chicago like I would get commission for it and I'm going to do the book the same way
4	4	I think I can speak for all Sox fans (and indeed all baseball fans) in saying how much I thoroughly enjoy seeing postings like the one below from "moochie" -- it just shows how fresh the pain still is, even a year after the fact!!
0	1	I agree that this book is absolutely essential to lawschool or practicing law. That's what makes even more horrible!!! I studied English all through college, and relied on the MLA handbook, which is great!! Why can't the Bluebook people hire the MLA people to come up with a legal reference book that is well-organized and not utterly confusing!! Of course, this review is worthless, b/c if you plan on going to lawschool, working as a paralegal, or doing anything legal, the bluebook is a must have, and there's no way getting around it
1	1	If you expect the same wonderful experience you received from reading &quot;She&quot;, you will be disappointed by this book. Leo and party travel to Asia to search for Ayesha and experience similar, but somehow tiresome, adventures. Reread &quot;She&quot; instead
4	4	When reading books about Chemistry or Physics, the level of depth is usually to the electron, proton, neutron, and there is usually some mention of quarks and antimatter and dark matter, but with no explanation of where these ideas are coming from. This book gives a good, nonmathematical description of the Standard Theory (Model) of particle physics, which gives a good account of what particles are known, how forces are treated using particles called Bosons. The books will answer any questions about what is known, but without proofs. I plan to study physics as an undergrad, and probably grad too, and have always been attracted to learning about the fundamental particles. This book was very satisfying for me, and will be for other interested students. Kane provides information about not only the standard theory, but also the facilities where research is done, where the field is going, and what a future student can expect. A quick read and definitely worth the time
3	1	This book scrapes greatness in its harrowing portrayal of obsessive love. Why isn't it a masterpiece? Because it doesn't so much end as just...stops. Still, a must read
4	4	I can't exactly say how a non-believer would take this book, there is that guy who wrote something about evilution producing this or that, but other than that I'll have to read the other reviews. Anyway the beauty of this book is in how well it illustrates the extreme extent to which God goes to in order to bring us to Salvation, while still holding the very fabric of life amidst consciousness and all of it's beauty and glory in careful suspension. I believe this is the notion of His love that Lewis is focused on. As a last resort method of God communicating with us, pain plays a - well - painful role, to which I'm no stranger. Still I'll bet that when we get to heaven God will truthfully say, it hurt me far, far more than it hurt you. Amen.
4	4	Professor Swain wrote an incredible account of both black and white representatives of African-Americans (both minority and majority districts) in the US Congress. She examines the history of blacks in Congress, the definition of &quot;black interests,&quot; and the difference between black descriptive and substantive representation. The book was originally written between the 1990 general election and the 1992 Presidential election. Although this may seem to make the book out of date, Dr. Swain updated her manuscript with an addendum to the first edition. This chapter covers the Republican Sweep of the 1994 general election and discusses its consequences to black descriptive and substantive representation. 'Black Faces, Black Interests' can be highly relevent to the historically minded, as the facts of the past shape the future. In this end, the author can have the most impact by educating readers, thus possibly touching the future representatives of African-Americans
1	1	There are more than 140 popular chart pattern. I returned this book becuase whatever he mentioned is freely available on websites. I do not want to publicize any website. But do a search in Google for 'Stock Chart or Technical indicator' and you will get better explanation and tips than what is in this book. I can not believe people go to seminar to hear this guy. The GOLDEN RULE... If the system works then may be start a hedge fund.. If it does not then write a book...hold seminar...
0	1	It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told. This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.
0	4	This is largely the same team of Letters who do the majority of lettering for Image Comics, and maybe one day when they decite to do it for a more professional comics company, then they can write a book like this, until then, NO SALE
1	1	The first book of this trilogy is the best. So rich in detail. Well defined characters. Such a good pace. It made me scour every bookshop I knew looking for the second and third books. When I found them, I got a distinct feeling that something or someone was rushing Ms. Hearn to finish the series...or she got bored with Japan....whatever the reason is it is to the detriment of the plot. You know when an unimaginative/bored person is telling a story? There's a lot of "and then...and then and then...". Hope you get my drift.
0	1	This book is lame. It's black and white drawings are sloppy and they don't instruct. There is little or no instructions This book is way over priced. Stay away from it
0	4	Dear Sean, Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon. All my best, Bill PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced
1	1	Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton
0	4	I had great hope -- sleep !!!!!! But it is just yet another book advocating abuse of the child for the ease of the parent. Yes, I want sleep. NO I will not sacfice my baby's secure attachment to me, and faith in me and the world to get it. crying it out is abuse pure and simply. Don't waest your time and money -- if you think this is how to raise a child, do yourfelf and the child a favor and giv the child to someone who will care.
1	1	I bought a copy of this book and it IS forcing me to give greater attention to an arguably important part of handicapping, therefore, it might be worth the money. While Klein's percentage of winners and return-on-investment calculations are adequate for the leaders at the first call, they are without merit for those that do not lead because he dumps both categories in together. This statistical error causes a disparity, but it only "seems" that the ROI between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. But, sheesh, there is only ONE leader but SEVERAL non-leaders. Using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%. Using Steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the "non-leaders" times 2)on the non-leaders. Even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the "win percentage" is just 14 percent. Unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a NEGATIVE return-on-investment! In my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment
1	4	Reading John Simon's latest compilation of film reviews begs the question, does one have to be "right" to be a great critic or can simply writing cleverly and rigorously in defense of a basically incorrect critical assessment suffice? What I have always admired about Mr. Simon is his unflappable way of sticking to his own view irregardless of the popular/critical consensus surrounding him. Yet Stanley Kauffmann tended to give negative notices to many of the same films as Simon while writing more sympathetically, insightfully and fairly about the works, so where does that leave Simon? Out in the cold I'm afraid. Reading this latest Simon book is exasperating as he snootily dismisses one great film after another (Au Revoir Les Enfants, Saving Private Ryan, etc.) I finally came to the consensus that however good a writer he is, he is simply too far off the critical mark...too often. Simon has a famous reputation for been gratuitously nasty toward female actresses whom he doesn't care for the looks of and that continues in this collection. As another reviewer notes, this latest collection also appears to solidify his reputation for being a homophobe too. Going all the way back to his review of Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet in 1968 (where he accuses the director of being a [...] because of the nude love scenes) to his recent review of My Own Private Idaho which he quickly dismisses as a "homosexual fantasy" his reviews have had a nasty homophobic edge to them, something Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael or Roger Ebert's writings have never had. And the fact that he liked Outrageous! (about a drag queen) back in 1978 and Savage Nights (about a bisexual HIV+ Frenchman) in the 1980's doesn't absolve him in my mind for all the nasty remarks he's voiced elsewhere over the years regarding "homosexuals" (he never uses the word gay, it's always "homosexuals". Simon's writing is just as caustic and technically proficient as always (and he still loves providing untranslated foreign quotes) but all that effort is at the expense of all too often unappreciative and skewed critical views. For my money, the essential critics remain Pauline Kael, Roger Ebert, Stanley Kauffmann and David Thomson, soon to be joined by Anthony Lane of The New Yorker
0	1	This book is simply hideous, and if the rating system would let me give it zero stars I would do just that. The text will not enlighten you if you do not understand audio signal processing, and if you already do understand it, nothing will be added to your knowledge. The only thing worthwhile about the book is the table of contents, since it does act as an outline of the subjects you should know, in order, if you intend to learn about digital audio signal processing. Following this table of contents as a guide, you should learn about psychoacoustics, digital signal processing in general, analysis & synthesis of sound, user interface methods, and finally effects specific to sound and compression methods if you wish to call yourself knowledgeable of audio signal processing. Unfortunately, you will learn none of that from this book. Instead, what you get is a sort of wandering novel consisting of the author's memoirs and musings on signal processing subjects. There are virtually no instructive diagrams, no equations, no pseudocode, just page after page of conversational text. Sure, I grant you that the author talks about subjects that I have not found in other texts, but that is part of the whole problem- he just chatters on incessantly about these subjects without being the least bit instructive. Some authors who write useless texts at least include source code on their CD's that partially make up for their lack of talent as writers/instructors. In this case you shall have no such luck. The code is one monolithic ball of lint so deeply entrenched in windows-specific MFC code that it is virtually impossible to unravel. There are no comments to speak of to enlighten you as to what is going on in any of the code. Instead the reader will find comments such as "i suggest somebody to fix that" and "saves typing later". If you do want to learn about digital audio processing, you might want to take a tip from the table of contents and start with psychoacoustics and pick up the excellent "Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics" by Perry Cook, which is good enough for self-study. For DSP for the music-centric reader, try "A Digital Signal Processing Primer : With Applications to Digital Audio and Computer Music" by Ken Steiglitz- it is very instructive, has plenty of equations and diagrams, and reads like a novel. Next, for analysis and synthesis of sound, find a copy of "Musical Applications of Microprocessors" by Hal Chamberlain. It was written in 1985, but it is an excellent introduction to sound analysis and synthesis in general and has a very good section on digital filters specific to audio. These three volumes should get you on your way to saying you understand digital audio processing. If you are a more advanced reader, read the two excellent volumes by Udo Zolzer- "Digital Audio Signal Processing" and "DAFX"- in that order.
0	4	I wish I had read these reviews before I bought the book. I would have saved myself $26.00. As an American who has traveled and now lives in Europe part of the year I was continually appalled at how she maligned other travelers. She writes of being invited to be a guest speaker on a cruise ship and insults in print all of the other passengers. She had a free trip while others paid, but she ridiculed everyone. I was totally horrified of the things that she said about her former Father-in-law. Those statements had no relevance to the book and they do not belong in public print. This man is the grandfather of her daughter. I am astounded at how she thrashed him publicly. Her book consisted mainly of telling the reader what town she was in, what was wrong with it and the rest of the chapter boring us with what books she was reading and quoting other authors, and relaying in detail every morsel that her and her husband ate. I have visited and even lived in several of the towns she wrote about. Of the ones I have not been to unfortunately, nothing she wrote made me want to visit them. I am an avid reader of travel books and essays. I will never again read anything by Frances Mayes.
0	1	Cannot remember a reading a worse book. Boring, uninteresting story, repetitive dialogue. The only good think about it is that it is very short
3	4	De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face. The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc. He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them. My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone. Nevertheless I recommend the book, especially for younger and middle aged women.
3	4	William O'neal covers all major stock trading areas in this book: how to find a broker, his CAN SLIM method for making money on stocks, When to sell,how to diversify, when to buy options, he shows charts of the biggest stock winners from 1953 to 1993, how to read stock price history charts and much more. It is a lot of information to take in and is not for beginners. I would advise reading "The neatest little guide to the stock market" before reading this book if you are just starting out in the land of individual stocks. Here is a summary of his CAN SLIM method to making money in the stock market, this is how to buy stocks: C= Current quarterly earnings:are they enough? A=Annual earnings increases:do they have meaningful growth? N=New products,New management,New highs:is it time to buy? S=Supply and demand:Small capitalization plus big volume demand equals price increase. L=Leader or Laggard:Only buy leaders. I=Institutional sponsorship:A little will drive up price. M=Market Direction=How to determine it and follow. The final chapter is 18 common mistakes most investors make, this is excellent advice for what not to do. This book's author believes in buying for growth with little regard to actual value or P/E ratios. He justifies this by showing all the the big misses a value investor would have had not buying hot stocks over the years because a value investor would have thought they were over valued, when they were priced at a premium due to growth factors. Great book I highly recommend
1	1	Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre. When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened. When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions. When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming. In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed. Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying. My question to Mr. Patterson is: If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first √Ø¬ø¬Ω of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end? Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)? I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters. Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel. My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense. For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows. Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing. This is ridiculous. Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find. How else do people buy drugs from them? It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames. Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal. It doesn't make sense. Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality. Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid.
1	4	Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories. Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people. But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original. The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about. None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation. We waited a long time for another Lehane. This book certainly does not showcase his talents
4	1	Here it is now, 2006, and we have moved back into the 50's in so many ways. Look at so many 20 somethings like Paris Hilton and the ways she disgraces herself without any inkling that she is doing it. Look at all the role models we see in films and TV, where women are either bitches, promiscuous, or over-siliconed airheads. Thank God Howard Stern is no longer on TV. We've come a complete 180 degrees, and women get no respect. I don't think Hilary Clinton and Condoleeza are any help. The women we see in public have no conception of how their public imcompetence, stupidity and general buying into the concept of woman as sex object for men has hurt us. Now men feel free to dispose of their wives by killing them. The number one cause of death of pregnant women is by homicide. Let a woman with a history of being abused by her boyfriend go missing, and the cops don't bother to look for her. It's OK to the authorities if young women get killed. Who cares except the grieving family? It's common in high schools for girls to be physically abused by their boyfriends, and the girls still love and protect them. Women are to be used, abused, and disposed of. Our society is run by men, for men, and it has not changed one bit in the past one hundred years. We can't even decide for ourselves anyomore if we want an abortion. Daddy government says no. All the right wing "Christians" running the country really just want to keep women in the dark ages before abortion, barefoot and pregnant and out of the work force. And women DON'T EVEN GET IT! I am currently packing to move to Scandanavia where women are respected and treated as equals. Birth control, abortions and prostitution are legal and accepted. Unlike America, in a few countries women at least own their own bodies
0	1	Dr. Dean Ornish is a quack, plain and simple. He is on the advisory board of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which is just a front for PETA. Do an exact phrase google of "The Dietary Delusions of Dean Ornish" to get the skinny on this fool. If you want to save your life don't waste your time on this book.
4	4	I purchased this book and was able to read it cover to cover in just a few days. Glenn Shepard has created a wonderful step-by-step guide that I consider a MUST READ for every small-business owner and manager or supervisor. As a national workshop leader Glenn combines his own experience as a business owner with the experiences and research from more than 100,000 managers from Forture 500 companies and small businesses alike. The author writes in a very straight forward manner -- and I like how he does not pull punches with addressing difficult employee behavior issues. Practical and informative -- I will require all my managers to read
0	4	I was looking for some christian books that will help me understand the bible better and found this one from the library. Just a glance of this book got me on the alert side. Although the title of the book bears the name of Jesus, it is largely based on the author's personal meditations than the bible. The author refers very little to the bible. And, the chapter "Rise Above Karma" annoys me as it relates "Karma" to the bible teachings. Is not "Karma" a term for Hinduism and Buddhism? What is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of God and Jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books. The bible tells us to beware of teachings like this
4	4	I loved this book. The pacing was perfect, the characters well-drawn, and the writing style engaging. Mickey Haller, the Lincoln lawyer of the title, and protagonist, is a hustler who works out of the back seat of one of his Lincolns. He gets embroiled in a case that should be a real money maker. The author uses this background to set up a very believable ethical dilemma that makes this novel a very compelling read. This is the first Michael Connelly book I've read, but based on this one, I'm going back to read his others
1	3	I read this book after being enchanted by the Accidental Tourist and other of Anne Tyler's books. This book deals with the life of a depressed teenage girl and unless that kind of thing interest you, I would not recommend reading it. On the up side, it's really short so you can get through it rather quickly. I was hoping to read a good book, but only felt worse after finishing this one
1	1	Judging by the long reviews before me, it should be obvious that there is much to say about Calvin's theology. This book doesn't say too much. For those familiar with his theology, DON'T buy this book. It will be a waste of your money. For those who would like to know more about Calvin's theology, without getting caught in mid 16th century language or too deep into theology, buy this. If you want a good in depth coverage of Calvin's theology, buy the FULL version and enjoy
1	4	I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture. Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing. In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it
4	4	This is a marvelous guide book. We intended to visit Plymouth on our vacation this year but did not make it. However, we plan to take this book with us when we go next year. Dr. Jehle goes through all the signifcant sites at Plymouth and takes you through the history (the real history, not the revisionist, politically correct nonesense that passes for history today) of that site/monument in detail. He acknowledges the contributions of both the Pilgrims and the native peoples and highlights the strong faith of our founders as well as that of many of those in the native population. I highly recommend this, especially if you want to teach your children the history of our founding
4	4	Dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up, 16-year-old John Grady Cole heads for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen. They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer. Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be. Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere. Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it. His long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel, and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the Texas/Mexico border region to vivid life.
1	1	James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers. I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem? Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree
0	1	I was quite disappointed with Ballast's Graphic Division review. Not only is the book itself sloppily laid out, and quite incomplete in regard to the information provided within it, there are much better alternatives out there. Norman Dorf's "Solutions" guide is a much better preparation guide, one that I wholeheartedly recommend to anybody about to tackle the ARE Graphic Exams
3	4	Transaction codes, good explanations, clever questions, well throughout answers and bonus material beyond anything else out there. Great book and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning BW or interviewing someone for a BW job
0	1	I cringed while reading this book and actually flung it across a waiting area at a gate in Heathrow Airport in disgust upon finishing it. (No one was in the way and I did retrieve it - to throw it out properly in a trashcan.) Mr. Rushdie is obviously a brilliant man but he is out of his element writing about rock and roll. I felt embarrassed for him while reading this and I really did want to love it. The language is forced and pretentious; it sounds like it was written by a corporate CEO desperately trying to be cool.
3	4	The Preface of this book reveals that the author's daughter &quot;completed three fascinating and challenging years as an analyst for Enron Corporation.&quot; Indeed
3	4	The "Bird Flu Preparedness Planner" delivers what it promises in a clear, compelling, straight-forward way. Dr. Woodsen lays out the facts of this health threat with no hype and no panic. However, it is real, it is deadly, and it is heading our way. The most valuable feature of this slim, easy-to-read manual, is its simplicity and practicality for preparedness. It has checklists of supplies, medicines, and food a family would need in case of a severe epidemic or pandemic. I will try to get Tamiflu (to help with ordinary strains of influenza) and the over-the-counter remedies he recommends. I think the food list could have been a bit more comprehensive. I plan to have more than rice and potatoes on hand to feed a family of six for eight weeks. However my grocery list looks more like a summer cookout for a family reunion than an emergency stash. I suppose 8 cases of baked beans and 8 summer sausages is a little over-the-top.
4	4	If that slow, plodding Ric Burns series on PBS was the official history of New York City, &quot;You Must Remember This&quot; is the indispensible people's history: actual voices from the turn of the century (the last century) telling what it was really like to live in the immigrant Lower East Side, the Hell's Kitchen waterfront, Jazz-era Harlem, the last stretches of rural Inwood. With this and &quot;The Box,&quot; Kisseloff is hands-down the most perceptive and consistently fascinating oral historian I've read, and yes, that's counting Studs Terkel. Buy one for yourself, and one for a history-lovin' friend
4	4	this book was totally awesome! i mean people think that a sequel would just completly suck but no! it was great. i was very suprised how the author pulled me in with all the quirky romance, AGAIN! i can not express how great this book is. BUY IT! READ IT! anybody who loved the first one will abosolutly without a doubt love the second one
4	4	This is an enormous work and very important too, and even though it is difficult to present to a &quot;modern&quot; mind David Frawley has done a great job. The work consists of understanding and interpreting the Vedas properly, which are almost 6-7 thousands years old if not more and are written in Vedic Sanskrit, which again is more complex to understand and interpret than regular Sanskrit. This is a book is very important from the point of ancient India's (true) history as well as is extremely important from the point of view of world's history as we understand today. It is a book that also provides the much-needed encouragement and foundation for anybody seeking a spiritual way of life
0	0	More crap from Plimpton, the very definition of athletic supporte
1	1	Love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that doesn't really have a point. It really seems to be just Sam's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup. There are some great anecdotes woven through the book (and I'm sure he has plenty that aren't shared). He goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic. At the end of the day I'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly. It dosen't go into the brewing in any depth and there's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book. If your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest
4	4	The first time I saw this movie, there was one scene which scared me; the scene where Mary's parents are dying from the plague (I think it was cholera?). The music they use for this can send chills down someone's back; I know because it did mine. Apart from that, I loved the movie. I don't know why they had to have Dickon killed, though. (Ben Weatherstaff and Mary talk at the end of the movie; we find out that Dickon was killed in the war.) I like how Colin and Mary meet at the end and how Mary held off on saying yes to Colin's marriage proposal until they were together in the garden. Something else I'm wondering: Was this movie set during World War 1 or World War 2?
1	1	When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt. But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog. Long, boring, and confusing. I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them. It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin. What a waste. What a shame.
1	4	The book is written with the purpose to be an "up-to-date [source about] DC/DC converters for students and practicing professionals". It is a shame how this target is not reached. Since from the very begin, the introduction, you will face an answer: what is its usefulness? You'll hope that, going on reading, everything will be clearer, and, from a certain point of view, this is what you get: what you've seen in introduction is eventually explained so that it could be useful even to students. However the text neither is "practical" nor gives you the "in-depth-analysis" you were hoping since its title begins with "Advanced". Schematics are rarely useful to understand the following analysis and are often badly sketched/printed. Mathematical derivations are quite good but not enough to fulfill designers needs. Apart from this it is a good effort. In my opinion readers should have to wait the next edition, if there will be a next edition
0	1	I read about this book in a catalog, I was intrigued, so I ordered a copy. The book arrived today I read through it and found it to be quite ordinary. It wasn't a smooth read. Very choppy. Not inspiring in fact it was somewhat depressing. I was very disappointed. I will return the book to the catalog company today for a refund. Save your money and look elsewhere for life changing book
0	1	Read this book! The story of a half-Chinese, half Jewish halfwise autograph man, a drunkard and drug addict who doesn't get along with life, love and religion, sadly isn't even half-interesting or - behave - intelligent. In fact it is really annoying: the initial situation offers some some basic aproaches but Zadie Smith doesn't manage to develope them thrillingly. Anytime I felt just a little bit of excitement and turned the page to read on, it just started to get really boring again.
0	1	I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more.
4	4	This is one of the most beautiful pop-up books I have ever seen. As an adult without children, I have to say I would not want them handling it, as the work is so intricate and fragile. I wouldn't give this book to a child under 12 or so. That said, this book is truly a delight and a wonder and well worth owning. I don't know how the authors do it but they're amazing! Don't hesitate to buy it...just keep it away from your two-year-old. R-r-r-i-i-i-p!!
4	4	This book is a must-have for all Lennon fans. It has summaries and origins of all his songs from 1970- .It's full of photos, too! [...
4	4	I was having alot of problems and none of the several doctors and one specialist I tried knew what to do with me. I bought several thyroid books, but this one answered all of my questions. The author is eminently qualified to write this book, and has done so in a readable and down to earth, yet detailed way. Thyroid problems can affect every aspect of your life in ways you might not imagine--you need to be well informed and this book will do it
4	4	This book is of the highest quality, from its hard cover, to its glossy pages, to the photographs and historical records. This is the most detailed account of urban warfare in Stalingrad I have ever read. The book is fast-paced, easy to follow, thoroughly researched, and extremely informative. I could not put this book down and learned more about the streetfighting in Stalingrad than from all the other books I have read combined. If you want to learn about the horrific fighting in Stalingrad from a first-person perspective, this is the highest quality work I have encountered. I recommend it to anyone with an interest on the subject and can assure you that you will not be disappointed. A first class historical work all the way. Impressive! (On a side note, I specifically looked for the author emphasizing that he was only doing his job and only found one reference. So, I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer who stated that this was a repeat issue.
1	4	I bought this book for ideas and best practices. I work in retail design. The quality of the printing of the book was not very good; photos didn't give much of a sense of scale, materials used. And the examples seemed very dated to me. If you are a retail design professional, you are better off heading to a local mall, taking some notes and pics yourself
1	1	If this had been the first book by Iris Johnason I had read it would have been the last. I have read many of her books. This one is at the bottom of the pile! It was to long and drawn out. I thought it would never end. Several times I almost didn't finish it but thought it would pick up at some point. I was just borin
0	1	To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988" HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!! Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises. This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times. For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around. 1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon. Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply? The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough? One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948. The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system. Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course) It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began. 2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years." Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom. Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly. Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!
1	1	It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport. I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed. If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us. Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad..
4	4	In The Society of the Muslim Brothers, Richard P. Mitchell addresses the ideology of the organization. He takes the reader from the birth of the movement that would eventually challenge the Egyptian government to it's greatest and worst moments. He writes with an amazingly objective style, neither apologizing for the members who committed crimes, nor minimalizing the excellent social welfare contributions of Hassan Al-Banna, the leader. Of particular interest in this discussion of dualities is the point made about the dual legal systems. Al-Banna felt that the Western laws "corrupted and perverted the nation's thought, mind and logic." Mitchell's point on this seems to hold vivid clarity in the idea that manmade laws and shari'a are innately incompatible. The inharmonious combination of this dual legal system "served to shatter the `unity' of the nation." Mitchell's writing really catches the essence of a group of people struggling to come to terms with a rapidly changing society in flux in a rapidly changing world. His book was translated into Arabic and Arab scholars agree that his portrayal of this politically powerful religious movement is academically sound
0	1	I love Koontz; however, this was not his best effort. The book was almost boring
1	4	Wittgenstein said that the purpose of a popularization is to make people think they understand something they don't understand. What seems to be a common current of science popularizations is that they "explain" things in such a simplified way that the reader who actually wants to get down to brass tacks is completely mystified. Einstein's book on relativity is a case in point, as is this book in which the candid reader is informed that "Objects at rest tend to remain at rest, therefore heavier objects will fall faster in a gravitational field." Got that? If so, maybe you can explain it to me. Listen, I know something about Physics. Back in the seventies I built a particle accelerator out of a blow drier and a box of Mike and Ikes.
4	4	I am a law student who read this edition of Blackstone's Commentaries for a jurisprudence course, and it was a great experience. Blackstone details the inner logic and principles of the common law and why it stands as an equal among Greek, Roman, and civil law. He also systematically details the logic and basis for the law of civil rights, property, civil procedure, and criminal law in England. These sections provided me with a much better understanding of the origin and rationality behind our system of law. In addition he also explains the historical origins of the common law and the political structure of England's government at the time just before our nation's independence and why it had been superior, at that time, to any other form of government in all of Europe in the securing and preservation of human liberty. I highly recommend at least volume I to law students and even to any reader interested in better understanding the origins of our government. His explanations in particular will give you a much better understanding of how English government functioned and how our government distinguished itself in substantial ways from England. Any scholar, student, or avid reader of political science, law, or history will benefit and enjoy this great literary work. Ignore the earlier critique of the font, the facsimile of the first edition really transports you back in time and the font is not that difficult to navigate. The only real difference is "f" is used in place of "s" everywhere but in the last letter of words ("greateft" "fortrefs" "fubject" etc.). Generally it's very clear when the "f" is an "s" although there are a few confusing exceptions (e.g. "wife" is "wise" as in the "wife laws of England..."). The first edition included footnotes where Blackstone cited English, Latin, and Roman works and these are reproduced here as well.
4	4	The Secret History is a record of the Mongolian Royal families, which is thought to have been written during the thirteenth century. Paul Kahn has kept the original prose format in his translation, which I feel makes this the only version to own. It begins with the creation myth of the wolf and deer from which the Mongolian people (in legend) are descended from; throught he birth of Temujin, and ending with the ascention to the throne of Ogedai Khan. I highly recommend this to those who are looking for primary sources to add to their Asian history collections
3	4	If you like to explore provocative ideas, then you will enjoy Biocosm. Gardner begins by arguing that a strong version of the Anthropic Principal is required to account for the goodness of fit between the physical parameters of our current universe, and the parameters required for the evolution of intelligent life. He builds on Lee Smolin?s hypothesis (The Life of the Cosmos) that our current universe is the product of a long evolutionary history that has favored universes that could produce baby universes (in the form of black holes) and these same parameters are also favorable for intelligent life. Gardner points out (correctly) that Smolin's hypothesis does not explain how such baby universes inherit the parameters of their mothers, and then offers a provocative solution. It is our future intelligent progeny that program the physical laws into future universes (as they have in the past). This is Gardner's Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis (SB). Gardner rejects Linde's "eternal chaotic inflation" plus a weak version of the anthropic principal (ECI&WA) but it appears to me that Gardner needs Linde's idea to produce the FIRST universe with intelligent life. After that, SB might work. However, if ECI&WA is needed to get SB off the ground, then SB is no longer useful, since ECI&WA alone can account for the apparent goodness of fit between the parameters of the physical universe and the parameters necessary for intelligent life. Despite my concerns, I believe Gardner's book is worth reading because it addresses some of the critical issues and constraints that confront any acceptable theory of cosmic origins
0	1	OK, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. Don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from Lowest Rank First and read all the 1 star reviews as well. That way you can REALLY get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. Sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - "it's great!!" or "its sucks!!" But amongst all the one star reviews I discovered some smart punters whom i SHOULD have read before buying the damn book myself. Yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews I realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. This book is TERRIBLE. It gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. And the photos - MY GOD! Its Mr Steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for "flirting" and "body language" I've ever ever seen. And in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that I find highly disturbing. Yucko. As others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, I would. Avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague.
1	1	With new findings from a scientist of the Los Alamos laboratory, the main thesis of this book-that the Turin Shroud is a medieval forgery-has been dealt a death blow. The new information clearly shows that the portion of the Shroud used for the 1988 C-14 test was, in fact, an additional weave to the Shroud threads made much later than the cloth itself, and that the winding sheet is much older than C-14 indicated. Even without this explosive new information, much of Nickell's thesis was outdated well before the year 2005. His "recreations" of the Shroud are amateurish and are not clear evidence of forgery. Most of his other information-"paint on the Shroud", no provenance before the Middle Ages-has also been debunked many times over. And his star witness, Walter McCrone, had his own reputation tarnished beyond repair when it was proven that his analysis of the Vineland Map was discredited and debunked(ironic, since both Nickell and McCrone tried to destroy and besmirch those who didn't agree with them). In short, Nickell's book is now passe, and obsolete. It gets two stars for its entertainment value, but the main arguments and ideas of this book have been thoroughly refuted,once and for all.
0	1	Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer. If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day. Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time. The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly. They always show up as just a bunch of html code. Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly? Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him. But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before. He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy. I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods. Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it. For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings. Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!!
0	1	Do you feel different from people around you? Do they resent your ingenuity? Have you been kept from achieving your full potential by tradition-bound brutes who live only for base needs? Do you long for the company of others like yourself, who, tragically but inevitably, are biologically destined to wipe these shorter, darker subhumans from the face of the earth? Congratulations! You are either in the aryan nations or the Clan of the Cave Bear fan club, possibly both! (I exaggerate- you could be a nineteenth century English settler in Australia, or a Boer in South Africa, or maybe you just like Larry Niven, but that's beside the point) I can forgive Auel for the historical inaccuracies in the book. In the late 1970's when she did her research, we didn't have the genomic tools to reconstruct the lives of Neanderthals, and even now enough controversy persists to keep the discussion page lively over at Wikipedia. Ultimately we'll never know for sure what the paleolithic was like, and Auel's is if nothing else a vivacious fictional suggestion. Similarly, her bloated, almost puffy writing style is excusable in a first-time author, though one wonders what parasite infected her editor. I haven't read her more recent works, but I imagine she has probably improved. Even with the pendulous sentences Clan is not unreadable. What infuriates me is the casually racist subtext of the story, nowhere critiqued or even acknowledged. The story reads like a near-literal historicization of Helena Blavatsky's Secret Doctrine on the fall of the "aryans"- who interbred with "subhumans" introducing the world to, oh I dunno, domination by the unworthy, blind tradition, suppression of the individual, all the hallmarks of the book's neanderthal culture. Of course, even in this the blond-haired blue-eyed Ayla is innocent, overpowered by a brutish thug. Against this master narrative, all the admittedly interesting side notes about plant-based medicine and flintknapping make no impression. I would recommend anyone interested in paleontology take a trip to a museum or cruise the internet, and give Auel's books a wide berth. Also? Enough rape scenes already
1	1	This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash. Someone else knows about the money. The three major questions for the book to answer are: 1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it? I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered. Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere. 261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from. This is a legal thriller that does not thrill. The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does. Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening. I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance. Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it. If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash. He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake! I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it. Not Grisham's best, by a long shot
4	4	I waited a year for this next installment of the series and I started and finished it in under a week, now I cant wait for the next book! It hits home for my husband, he was stationed in the Bremerton area in the Navy. A good read
1	4	I bought this book as a gift for a friend based on the great categories it has to offer for recording book information. I was so disappointed to find that the spaces allowed for writing are so small. Also, the book is hard to navigate. The hard cover and hard binding don't allow for anyone to write it in it (inflexible). I gave it as a gift still, but I had to apologize for what a cruddy book it was
4	4	Just in case you had any doubts, this collection of essays (dating from 1968 to 1999) is clearly a major archive of achievement, demonstrating Stroud's preminence in American philosophy. Here is his articles in epistemology, which touch upon various topics: foundationialism, scepticism, and transcendental arguments. Stroud pays close attention to the challenges philosophical scepticism offers any theory of knowledge, and highlights just how skepticism is a serious problem in contemporary philosophy. He is also careful to argue for the &quot;invulnerability&quot; of certain thoughts and experiences
0	1	The feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, I couldn't fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with "could", "would have" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better.
4	4	Intimidating issues concerning the e-commerce revolution are resolved for small business owners when they follow Tiernan's insightful directions and explanations. My responsibility as coordinator of Project Entrepreneur is to assist people who wish to transition into self-employment. It is with confidence that I recommend e-tailing as the perfect companion to their e-business adventures
0	1	I wish Mr. Sparks would find the voice he wrote with in his earlier novels. That flow and voice I understood so well. At First Sight felt like I was reading a deadline novel. Just words, no insight, didn't make this reader think at all. Sorry, just the way I read it.
3	4	THE SCOLD'S BRIDLE, in my opinion, is one of Minette Walters' best mysteries--at least one of her best I've read so far! Her characters are well-developed, and the reader doesn't know from one page to the next who the murderer could be--NO ONE liked Mathilda, it seemed. Throughout the police investigation, readers are faced with learning of Mathilda Gillispie's abusive and haunting background of secrets, lies, and deception. Mathilda's character, though dead as the story begins, is developed more fully through her diary entries interspersed between chapters. Having left all of her money to an unlikely person, her doctor Susan Blakeney, Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter are brought into the story assuming they would inherit Mathilda's wealth. Readers find that Mathilda's daughter and granddaughter have experienced much of the intense emotional and physical abuse as Mathilda had. This part of the story, no doubt, leaves readers pondering how abuse often perpetuates itself through generations. Walters doesn't let on who the murderer is, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in its resolution given that the novel seemed more focused in a different direction. Overall, I enjoyed this novel moreso than THE ICE HOUSE or THE SCULPTRESS, but they are all very good books, and I would wholeheartedly recommend Walters to readers wanting a good mystery
1	1	A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.
1	4	I keep trying but cannot get interested in the stories by this author. They seem to drag out with her style of "he said/she said" writing with nothing exciting, except perhaps one part in this book. The story begins as the famous Lt. Bak is asked by his commander Thuty to investigate the disappearance of an explorer named Minnakht. His guide, Senna tells Bak of the disappearance and attraction to turquoise mines near the sea. The land is hostile and murder and death come as Lt. Bak questions each man over and over. The ending was not exciting or unexpected. Lt. Bak's constant referrals to the donkeys (we know how he is sympathetic to animals, this big strong medjay!! I had to make myself sit and finish it.
3	4	This book is straightforward, breaking down each step of the heroic journey, from the hero's birth to apotheosis, using examples from various mythologies/religions to establish the classical pattern used in literature. If you just want to brush up and increase your ability to identify the pattern in literature/pop culture (ie. Aliens movies, The Matrix, Xena, Buffy, Providence...) this is a handy reference and a quick read
1	4	Ms. Woodman's photographs are no different than hundreds being turned out in art classes everyday. They do, however, present a consistent body of work that with the continued intellectual growth of their author, could have made contribution the world of photography. We have been denied this growth curve and that is sad
0	4	Nietzsche, who started all this, may or may not have been the deepest thinker since Socrates, but he was a stylistic virtuoso. Deleuze and Guattari, on the other hand, were founder members of a postmodern cult whose watchword is: obscurity = profundity. But while some profound things may be ineluctably obscure, by no means all obscure things are profound. This book, which runs to 250 pages scarcely burdened by a coherently expressed thought, is in line for the prestigious prize, the Golden Merde de Taureau. It contains, along with much else, the authors' mature lucubrations on the foundations of calculus, which have greatly impressed readers who flunked high-school math. Others maintain that these passages are not about mathematics at all, just as the passages about science are not about science, and they may be right. What, if anything, it is about is anyone's guess, and many have speculated, some to their own satisfaction. One thing we can be sure of, because the authors tell us: they are creating concepts. This important work should not be undertaken by those in whom unfortunate defects of education have left a residual respect for language and joined-up thought. The book was a bestseller in France - possibly the most unread bestseller since a 'A Brief History of Time', but for different reasons
3	4	This book is filled with lots of interesting examples detailing life and attitudes in the fifties when the book was written. It is a book about how psychological research, motivational research was being employed at the time to sell Americans all kinds of things they did not necessarily really want, or weren't necessarily very good for them. Sounds very much like Reality as we now know it. This selling also extended to Politicians, and Packard foresaw the way the Image would become in many instances more important than the Message in choice of political candidates. As I said the book is filled with information. I am embarassed to say that I have in all my years on this planet and at various dentists never learned Packard's great insight that it does not make much sense to focus one's truth-brushing activities in the morning after the microbes have had eight hours to work on one 's teeth. Brush after you eat, he advises, as I now recall many dentists have told me through the years. In any case this is an enjoyable read by someone who understands that Advertising is not simply manipulative and exploitative but also adds color and interest to the culture.
1	1	The two best essays in this book had been previously published (perhaps in Oprah's magazine?). Most of the rest were shallow, not long-term friendships, and one even sounded like her hook-up of the month. Don't bother
1	1	Despite attempts to keep an open mind, I grew increasingly annoyed at the omissions, exaggerations and half-truths passed off as researched facts in this book. The author calls Cuba - a country under a dictator which holds no elections - a &quot;democracy&quot; and extols the virtues of the revolution without ever presenting the views and the injustices perpetrated against those who opposed the revolution. It is a shame that a work which could have been an objective scholarly book instead is little better than a propaganda pamphlet
4	4	I personally like all of Baba Raul Canizare's booklets on the Orishas, each booklet comes with various Patikis "Orisha Mythology and Legends" Songs, Chants, and Prayers. These booklets are a collection of the most popular Orishas as worshipped in the Orisha tradition of Lucumi. They are just booklets, and are good for the novice in the religion, or those who are curious about a certain Orisha. Worth the 4.95. Check out the whole collection.

0	4	I have some of Ehlert's other books and have found them to be wonderful, however, I found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it. Although the author portrayed activities that cats do, I was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children's book. I teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class
0	4	I am married to a Marine officer who is currently deployed to Iraq for the second time. As you can imagine, most of our friends are also Marine families. Additionally, my mother-in-law was a Marine wife for 35 years. This book is not representative of myself, my mother-in-law, or of ANY military spouse either of us know. Do not look to this book for an accurate impression of military life. I don't want to slam Ms Smiley. She is entitled to her own life experiences. HOWEVER, they are not typical "military spouse" experiences (far from it) so I am writing this review to make sure potential readers aren't duped into thinking this will give insight into the military life. It doesn't, and it won't. The spouses I know are the anti-Smiley. The spouses I know are educated, capable, strong, witty, caring, giving, women. The spouses I know would never behave this cowardly toward their military service member or be this careless with their marriages. I shudder to think that readers would think that she represents me, or any other spouse I know. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK if you want to learn real, interesting things about the military. Read "Making The Corps" instead. Do not read this book if you like inspired, compelling story-lines. Regardless of the military angle, the story is weak and the writing is bad. Am I qualified to judge a good book? Maybe. I read about 25 books a year and I am fairly well aquainted with the best seller lists. In the end, though, it's all about your personal taste. Read this book if you like non-best-seller-list chic lit
4	4	This was the first book I read by Deaver. It got me hooked. I loved the suttle twists in the plot. Very real. I could really see these things happening to someone. If you have never read anything by Deaver, read this one first
1	1	I bought a dog-eared copy of this collection (&quot;Trouble is My Business&quot;) at a book sale for $1.50 a year ago. The copy I have is thick with 12 stories. I bought this copy of &quot;Trouble is my Business&quot; to have a better copy, but was disappointed to discover that it had been whittled down to only the final four Marlowe stories. My question is, what the hell happened to the first 8 and why is Amazon.com still describing this as a collection of 12 when there are merely four? That's not jake, fellas
4	1	This was a great addition to the series. I love the way Anne Bishop writes I could read her books over and over. The book had a great blend of humor and suspense. I wanted more storyline on some of the characters but the book seemed to drop them. Ari was not in this book much which was too bad, I like her character. The book left an opening for another book or a spinoff. If there is no plan to write another book I will be disappointed because there are some characters I would like to follow up on
4	4	The book is beautifully produced. The quilts in the show are well documented and photographed. I received the book promptly and in excellent condition
1	1	It's a good basic overview, but the errors in the code snips are just too frustrating. I bought it because it was recently published (2006). But trying to get PEAR to work (DB.php has been superseded by MDB2.php) and even the simple form were exercises in futility. If you do use it get an AMP package (google: Uniform Server) and skip the install section. You'd think O'Reilly could include and AMP stack on a CD in the book and use that 20 pages for another exercis
4	4	First, let me say that I am a very independent, very headstrong, liberal wife who has a higher education than her husband (masters' degree), owns a business and takes no B.S. from anyone. When this book came out, I truly thought it was a joke. WHO WOULD WRITE A BOOK LIKE THIS OUTSIDE OF THE 1950s?! And WHERE IS THE "PROPER CARE... OF WIVES"?! To add 'insult', a coworker of my husband (whose wife stays at home with their 4 kids because they feel that this is THE role wives are SUPPOSED TO take on), is the one who offered to lend it to me. I thought, "this will be interesting" but can't criticize until giving it a shot, right??? Ok - there's the background - here's the review: I couldn't put the book down and read it in a just over a day. While I don't agree 100% with all that Dr. Laura says, and as another reviewer commented that there are parts that men may find insulting, this book has changed my life, and as a result it has changed my husband's life - both for the better. After 7 years of marriage, we are clicking like we never have before. I can't explain it to you, or to my married best friends whose jaws dropped as I confessed to them over margaritas that I NOT ONLY READ the book but I LOVED the book. All I can say is that the foundation makes sense. It doesn't bash working women - Dr. Laura is one, after all. But it does point out, not so discreetly, that your family - the family you have chosen to create - should come above all else. And that the EXTREMISM of some aspects of the feminist movement is self-destructive to women, men and society as a whole. And as I turned each page and as I tried to rebel against some parts (I shouldn't BURDEN him with the tales of MY day??!), peel away the layers, let down your defenses and let it make sense. (It isn't that my day is less significant, but men and women communicate differently - vent to him about your day and he'll feel like a second class citizen and a failure for not being able to fix your stress. Vent to your girlfriends and they'll dish with you! Focus your time on your husband, family, relationship, etc., once you get home instead.) AND LET ME TELL YA once you leave the work day at the door, your home becomes YOUR HOME again, too. So it's win-win! REALLY!!! Dr. Laura's book includes parts and pieces of past calls and letters, which is a helpful, practical demonstration of her points and breaks things up so you don't feel like you're getting a lecture (especially if you are ready to admit you've been doing a few thngs wrong!). And as you can see the lightbulb go on with average Janes all over the country and across time in the dialogue- from them pushing back on her advice to (aha!) getting her message during their conversations, you see the pettiness we can cling to and frankly, the underlying simplicity in each of her messages. OK - still skeptical? Then rent it at the library for free and give it a shot. Just TRY to put her ideas into practice - commit to changing for a week (if you aren't sold on changing your life)... What's the worst that can happen? If it's all wrong for you, you have just lost a quick week and you can pat yourself on the back for being right and you can write your own book. ;-) But just think - what if it WORKS?! Then you will find a new meaning in your life that you didn't know you were missing. You will have a much happier and rewarding marriage. Your husband will adore you. (Sounds rough, huh?) TRUST ME - I'm not about to become a submissive, mindless person rather than an equal partner in a relationship. But as I made a few MINOR tweaks in how I treat the man I chose to marry and spend the rest of my life with, I have received rewards from him 10-fold. And to think I thought I was doing it 'right' all along. ;0)
0	1	I had to use this particular book for a class I was taking. I was hoping for at least a balanced presentation, but I was very disappointed with this book. I found it to have a definite anti-life view. I found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics. Especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics. I also found that the author tried to present Catholic Church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the Church developed these views
3	4	I cannot claim to know much about Philip K. Dick as this is, thus far, the only one of his novels I have read. But based on a reading of The Game-Players of Titan, it will not be the last. The premise of the inhabitants of Earth playing the game, Bluff, for spouses and land is wonderful and the story only grows weirder and more original with each passing chapter. The only small quibble is the ending is somewhat anti-climatic after the strongly built, witty, creatively heightened build up but this book is about the journey and one could have no better guide than the author for this unique trip
1	1	I ordered this book because I really like to cook and love legumes and my pressure cooker. Perhaps I should have looked elsewhere. The recipes in here are nicely put together with the nutrition information and there is quite a bit of information on legumes. However, I found that there were too many Southwestern Chili type recipes for my taste. If you like to make chili and lots of Mexican and Southwestern inspired dishes this might be the cookbook for you. That is not to say that there aren't some Mediterranean and Caribbean inspired recipes but it just seems that the Tex-Mex and Southwestern flavors beat out the others. Also, I happen to loathe margarine and avoid it at all costs. I love to cook and would much rather use less butter or a combination of canola oil and butter or olive oil or even an olive oil spray -- anything but margarine. Not only does this cookbook call for margarine specifically, but diet margarine. In the same vein I understand that the author is an M.S., R.D. but I really don't think there is a need to use Fat-Free Dressing for everything. I also didn't like that one of the recipes called for onion soup mix. I have never purchased onion soup mix and try my best not to purchase lots of processed foods. Thus, I get very uneasy when a cookbook uses these types of ingredients. One more irksome tidbit was the fact that there weren't any recipes or mention of other beans such as the anasazi, adzuki, flageolet, cranberry to name a few. This cookbook might not be the best cookbook for someone looking for a wider repertoire of legume recipes than your Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook can offer
0	1	Frankly, Sex Magick is much simpler than this book would have us believe. Masturbate to enter an altered state of consciousness over a Sigil. Have extended periods of sex to accomplish the same goal. Simple, no? And, guess what? That's all this book says, as practical information goes. The rest is conjecture, faulty history or useless anecdote specifically there to make you impressed
4	4	This book is beautifully written. Even in translation, I was amazed by how gorgeous Pamuk's prose is. Some sentences from this book lingered in my head for days afterward. The main character, Ka, is a poet, and the novel itself seemed very poetic to me, but not at all in a dense or difficult way. Indeed, "Snow" flows so smoothly that I would say it's a fairly easy read. I wasn't sure if I would like this book at first because I didn't think I was particularly interested in Islam and politics. I discovered that "Snow" is primarily about God, love, beauty, happiness, death, life, and loneliness. While all the action takes place in a tiny Turkish village, the themes are broad, sweeping, vast. This book will not grow dated any time soon, if ever.
4	4	Great tale of what it is like to be a modern day Texas Range
3	1	It's no secret that people who are trying to sell you something will be very careful and sometimes dishonest when it comes to the actual words and phrases they use to describe their product. In TALKING RIGHT, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg examines the use of language manipulation as it has been used in modern American politics and the effect it has had back on the language itself. Since the birth of advertising, sellers would spend many hours writing and rewriting slogans, bumper-stickers and sales pitches to make sure that each word had the desired impact on the listener. But Nunberg's research is more interested not just in how language is utilized by the political salespeople, but how certain words and phrases in the vernacular have ended up being subtly changed by constant repetition and reenforcement from politicians, pundits and spin-meisters. While the word "liberal" is obviously where the book hangs its hat, other words and phrases have also migrated to take on different meanings and connotations. For example in a political context, when someone refers to "values", they actually are only discussing a small subset of possible moral issues, regardless of their position on other subjects. Even a word as old as "Christian" is taking on a more restrictive definition. TALKING RIGHT is written in an easy-to-read style. It's breezy and almost conversational without feeling shallow. I found to it be a little repetitive at times (odd, considering the relatively small word-count), but I forgive it because of all the little facts that I hadn't know. I had, for example, recently noticed Republicans referring to their opponents as "the Democrat Party". But I hadn't realized that the deliberate shortening of "Democratic" has been a tactic going back over 70 years. The book is told mainly from a liberal point of view. This is because of Nunberg's thesis (and I think that most would agree) that the right-wing has been far more successful at branding words and phrases as belonging to their side of the national discussion. Nunberg picked up on a lot of things that seemed familiar to me. Things that I had noticed but hadn't realized that I noticed. It's a very illuminating book in that way; it crystallizes a lot of things I had only half-realized while listening to left-wing and right-wing talking heads exchanging insults on cable news
1	1	I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them. I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book. What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd? Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know
0	1	I ordered this book hoping for some scientific evidence supporting what I already knew from personal experience; that there is a gestalt emerging from all of the beings in the universe. An emergent property that some call `the spirit that moves through all things' and some call `god' and I was hoping that this book would call it Gaia. Bah! The author totally ignores the metaphysical evidence and misrepresents the impact of civilization on the natural world. He also misrepresents the relationship tribal aka primitive cultures had with the natural world. Furthermore, this isn't even good science. Typically I pass books on to friends or trade them at a used bookstore. The best thing about this book was how easily the pages tore out to become kindling for my fire. If I could I would give it a negative rating -- don't pollute your mind with this trash
4	4	Being gifted doesn't mean you know everything and have figured everything out. It just means you're brighter than the average bear and can leap to conclusions and see connections faster than others. You also remember better and thus cannot stand things being repeated over and over. Unfortunately, because society is designed for those who are less bright, this causes problems for the gifted. This book explores what those problems are. Both while growing up and as adults. A very enlightening book and one I recommend to those who are gifted or who are parents of gifted children/adults
0	1	i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages. i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign. i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something. the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP! PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY." guess what, mr. sedaris? i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood. millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card. check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.
4	4	This books makes the cutest models and manipulative things! If you make lapbooks, or notebooks for your units this would be the thing to get. There are things here I have seen nowhere else. It is adaptable up or down to the grade level it shows. Perfect for homeschooling. I have used some of it in a group as well
1	4	"The best way I know to resuscitate the theatre is to produce dangerous new works," says Stuart Ostrow in his very slim (154 pages, double spaced with wide margins) new memoir of his producing career. However he does not define "dangerous new works." From reading the book, it seems his definition of "dangerous new works" is whatever is being touted by the Village Voice. (Richard Foreman, homosexuality, multiculturalism, Tom Eyen, etc.) Stuart Ostrow has a story, but he is looking at it from the wrong point of view. The way he sees it, he was producing quality innovative stuff that the world conspired to make fail. Another way of looking at it would show a talented young producer who, after producing big hits with 1776 and PIPPIN, went pretentious and politically correct with his subsequent shows and understandably failed. His damnation of Mel Brooks is unjustified since Ostrow himself says that he has not seen THE PRODUCERS. Well, Stu, I have news for you. THE PRODUCERS was a dangerous new work. It was a slap in the face at political correctness and pretentiousness. It single-handedly killed the bloated Euro Musical that had dominated Broadway for twenty years and paved the way for outrageous, unpretentious shows like HAIRSPRAY and THE WEDDING SINGER. THE PRODUCERS resuscitated the American musical and Ostrow missed it. Ostrow also badmouths WICKED claiming it was dependent upon special effects and spectacle. If that were true, DANCE OF THE VAMPIRES would still be running. The spectacle of WICKED enhances its compelling story, unlike the all the additional sets and extra players gratuitously inserted into the boring LA BETE. Ostrow seems to think that problems can be solved by creating yet another bureaucracy to choose the artists who shall be anointed. Evidence has show that the bureaucratic method produces pretentious work like that of Michael John LaChiusa and Jason Robert Brown, which the public doggedly refuses to embrace. Ostrow tells some good anecdotes, but I wish there had been more of them. There's the germ of a fascinating book in this volume and in Ostrow's previous memoir (also extremely brief and shares some material with this volume). But at this point, there's still not a real book between the two of them
4	4	Excellent presentation of the material in an easy to follow format. Allows the reader to pinpoint exact areas of interest, and contains only information pertainent to the title. A must have for writing resumes with confidence and skill
0	4	The main character of Hospital Sketches is Nurse Tribulation Periwinkle. The book is about her experiences as a nurse at a Washington D.C. hospital during the civil war. The theme is cheerful despite the wounded men. One man showed his gratitude for the way she helped him stay cheerful by offering "I've got a pair of earbobs and a handkerchief pin I'm a-goin' to give you"(Alcott 69). Cheerfulness is shown when a nurse says, "Bless their hearts..."(Alcott 75) because she is so proud of the soldiers. The Author makes everything more confusing than it has to be. For instance, "as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances that lighted us to bed"(Alcott 75). She uses this sentence to say that people smiled at the nurses as they went to bed. She often switches from one subject to another without making any indication of it, leaving you confused. "At the beginning of my reign, dumps and dismals prevailed"(Alcott 77). She says this while she is telling you about the breakfast she is eating. That has nothing to do with breakfast. She is unclear about what she is referring to. The main Conflict doesn't come until the end. She gets sick and needs to decide whether to keep on working there, or go home and try to get better. She decides to go home because her father says, "Come home." I think this book was poorly written, and I don't recommend it to anyone
4	4	Avorn's beautifully written book seems to become more important for "the rest of us" with every breaking news story about the pharmecutical industry. My suggestion in the light of the Vioxx disaster? If you are interested in your own health and the medicines we take so casually, then buy a copy of this beautifully written and oh so revealing book. Let me give you a flavor of just how good a writer Avorn he and how revealing this book is by quoting the way he introduces a chapter from this book: "In a former British colony, most healers believed the conventional wisdom that a distillation of fluids extracted from the urine of horses, if dried to a powder and fed to aging women, could act as a general tonic, preserve youth, and ward off a variety of diseases. The preparation became enormously popular throughout the culture, and was used widely by older women in all strata of society. Many years later modern scientific studies revealed that long-term ingestion of the horse-urine extract was useless for most of its intended purposes, and that it caused tumors, blood clots, heart disease, and perhaps brain damage." This (sad) "fairy tale" introduces the whole sorry tale of hormone replacement therapy for women, and how badly the research was to defend it. The book just gets better from here
4	4	This is the first volume of Churchill's Noble Prize winning six part chronicle of World War II. The Gathering Storm depicts the rise of Hitler and the indifference of the leaders of the European democracies to the clouds of the gathering storm. Churchill incorporates contemporary documentation and his own reminiscence in this opening memoir. Churchill was a great statesman with great literary ability - a winning combination. The Gathering Storm a unique work and has a message for us in today's world. Read and reviewed by Jimmie A. Keple
4	4	perhaps this is the most romantic and most beautiful book of love poems ever written. every word, every stanza is so easily read, so quickly understood, like an arrow to the heard. give this gift to your lover and they will never forget it
1	1	Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book. The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance. There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity. The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores. Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket. Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs. Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness. The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else. The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent. Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style. It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced. I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype.
0	1	I bought this hoping to add to my collection of Judy Reeves's prompts, unfortunately all this is is a repackaging of A Writer's Book of Days: A Spirited Companion and Lively Muse for the Writing Life. The year's worth of prompts are in the kit's book, followed by lined pages. The advice and encouragement on the kit's cards can be found among the pages of her Writing Book of Days. I'm very disappointed that Reeves couldn't create more prompts rather than simply making more money off of her previous work
4	4	We got this book last year at Christmas, and it has some great ideas for &quot;spontaneous' games that you can play with the kids while traveling. Whether you are going by car, plane or train, the kids frequently get antsy or bored. There are many games that take no planning, and use common things around you, to entertain, get silly, and just enjoy
0	1	I'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far. Unless you're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you're going to find yourself lost and disinterested. The first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what I thought would be a good story. The remaining chapters had little connection to this however. The book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk, little character development, tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters. Even Clancy's much maligned Red Rabbit is far superior to this
0	4	Getting ready to go on international assignment, I picked up a copy of this book. The author's breathless inanities ran along the lines of (a paraphrase), &quot;wow, some British men used to wear bowler hats.&quot; I found very little useful in this book to prepare me for the transition, and was occasionally offended by his borderlne racist generalizations. I was expecting sociology and got sleaze instead
3	4	I myself write westerns, so I bought this book in the hopes that it would help my writings be more accurate. While the information contained in this book isn't quite as specific as I would have liked, it does have some very interesting and entertaining facts, such as slang terms cowboys used, the terms used for the different hairstyles during the 19th century, and common diseases that plagued the population. It also lists the different types of horses, which is a tremendous help for me. If you write novels or are just an avid history buff (of which I am both), then I think you will find this book interesting
0	1	The biggest disappointment of this book is that the comments about the CIA - training and operation - are akin to what might have been written at the end of the day into a diary. There was passage after passage that begged for insight that her (limited) experience brought, but I don't remember a single case of finding this. The criticism of the CIA training is rendered in terms of the students' shortcomings in the exercises, with no thought to why they didn't do better, or if their performance - while not good - was in fact passable. I suspect that the people from the intelligence agencies that gave high marks to this book are doing so because they find the public criticisms of the CIA refreshing and useful/needed, and that they could fill in the insights on their own. Despite having read multiple of the reviews here, I was still unprepared for the sheer amount of time talking about her personal life (one reviewer overstates it as being 75%) and how trite it was. The reviews here had prepared me for the arrogance of a 30-something, but what I encountered was more the self-absorption of a teenager. The librarian who shelfed this book in the teen section may have been making a different editorial comment than the reviewer (2006-Aug-15) who reported it (reviewer gave it 5 stars for the teen reader). The book has many hints and clues that the author is substantial and interesting, and this may keep you reading. However, that person never emerges
3	4	This work grabs you immediately with its description of the "standstill" procedure. A patient is placed into a coma, the blood and body chilled and then the heart actually stopped while the surgeon skillfully digs around in the grey matter. Fascinating stuff. The author is a journalist obviously awed by Dr. Spetzler and all that he (and others) have accomplished at the Barrow Institute in Phoenix--the book is primarily a story of Dr. Spetzler's career and secondarily the developing science of neurosurgery. The reader is treated to descriptions of the daily life of residents--rounds, M&M conferences, surgical procedures, etc. There are the obligatory descriptions of the hideously expensive gadgetry and imaging technology that has made modern neurosurgery possible. But something was missing. In attempting to simultaneously cover the entire field of neurosurgery (as well as a curious diversion into the history of Phoenix) this book lost some of its punch. This could easily have been an incredibly interesting biography of Dr. Spetzler (and if anyone writes one--I'm buying it), or a surgical techno-thriller about standstill procedures curing otherwise hopeless cases . Better yet, a treatise on the cost/benefit tradeoffs presented by modern medicine with its increasing dependence upon pricey machines. Not to mention the peculiar danger of saving a patient from a horrible aneurysm only to find that his or her personality is irrevocably changed--and not for the better. Unfortunately, the work was somewhat diluted by its lack of focus. Nevertheless, highly recommended
1	1	This book was a new choice from our professor who was teaching our mechanism design class. In my opinion, the three authors who wrote it each took a section and slapped their parts together. Totally different writing style as you go throught the book. In addition t is a small book and you constanlty are turning pages to makes references to figures which makes it hard to read with good flw. n addition a lot of the diagrams are unclear and dont necessarily say what they represent. Our professor ended up hating the book himself. A good reference maybe but not for the beginner
3	1	an analysis of this sort was sorely needed. this book is factual in addition to being cute. i would highly recommend it to anyone
4	4	I'd like to know where I can get one of these famous-cities skirts...especially if they draw in handsome young Southern studs like Logan Bruno
3	4	This is oe of my favorite suspense authors. I wish she would write faster. I really have enjoyed all of her books. They are well written and interesting, exciting stories. Definitely recommended
0	1	Edward Said, created a proble and made a career of the Israel Palestine Conflict, and conviently died before he could also resolve the death and destruction he brought to the Arab Palestinians. He was a one man destruction derby under the guise of poetry, linguistics and hate and he helped stir up anti Israel and anti Jewish hatred on every University he spoke at. Hopefully, this "vintage" book will become no longer relevant, ans disappear
4	4	Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying "Truth is stranger than fiction" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments
3	4	Another entertaining book in the series. Good fun with some real life problems. Book eight is enjoyable too
3	3	Poirot is given a case by his old pal Spence which takes him to a small village, where the fussy detective must unravel clues behind a crime in which the main suspect has already been arrested and sentenced... Hercule's indignities at the run down boarding house he's staying at make up the bulk of the story's humor, but the mystery is great fun, too and I doubt anyone can guess the killer, unless you're paying amazingly close attention. The characters here are some of Agatha's most entertaining, and Mrs Oliver, with her uncanny intuition, always makes a nice flighty side kick..
3	1	Once again it is another good read by Grisham. It is hard to think what my will would be like if I get over a million dollars. I cannot see leaving it to a woman in some remote southn american jungle
1	1	sorry, i just thought the book was boring and worst of all, its a good story with alot of food for thought, but it was just written so poorly that it was ruined
0	1	This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective. The research is suspect. The prose amateurish. The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work
0	4	this book stinks on ice. No offense of corse. This is not one of NB's best books. I read ten pages and then i knew the ending. A boy goes on top of a volcano to find a monster. it turns out the monster is, well i won't give the ending away. Stick to your Harry Potters and Artimis Fowl. I really advise you not to by this book. Please don't. I am not sure if you will but if you do buy it, it will be in the garbage can in two days or les
3	0	I enjoyed reading it and was surprised at all they went through
0	4	What so many past and even some current chelas overlook is that there is a difference between Sri Harold Klemp, the man, and the ECK which uses and continues to use him as ITS divine channel in all the worlds of God. Recently I took the fourth initiation in ECKANKAR. Yesterday, while in contemplation I sang my new secret word with my attention on the current Living ECK Master and experienced the Light of God. Ford Johnson's assertion that chelas are prevented from becoming Masters is a falsehood. Before Millie Moore translated she had reached the Ninth Initiation, the point at which ECK Mastership commences. It's sad to see a former High Initiate like Ford Johnson who has become 'twisted by the Dark Side'
0	4	Why do I feel like the serpent in the Garden of Eden?... Sorry, I really liked "Deep Waters", but I probably won't buy another JAK unless I am stuck at an airport and I have read every other available Romance, Mystery or Thriller on the newsstand. I think I have made myself clear. It is time for me to find some new talented authors. Although I know I have some previously read titles of hers to review. Hopefully, they are better than this
4	4	I first read Martin's Hundred when I was in the hospital waiting to give birth to my first child. I managed to stay interested between my labor pains, and that says a lot about Mr. Hulme's writing! I've re-read it four times since. The archaeological details and interpretations are utterly fascinating, especially those of the pointed-roof coffins and poor &quot;Granny's hairdo.&quot; The colonists who inhabited the Carter's Grove site really came alive for me. This is an all- time favorite book of mine
3	4	a very well-considered look at the realtionship between digital communications technology and local communities, with particularly good treatment of public access, education, and attempts to use computers to enhance, rather than undermine, neighborhood and community relations. Highly recommended
3	4	The book moves, is enlightening, funny, and educational. If you have ever walked in the woods, it might not look the same again
1	1	Morris believes that the Bible can be scientifically proven. This is impossible, since the Bible is a religious text. It is an interesting read, but keep in mind that Morris uses bad science and fallacy after fallacy to make his religion look scientific
0	1	I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad. It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were. Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin. The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books. I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book. I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo
4	4	As a Texan who first moved to Europe at age 13 in 1961, Pell's book was like reading the story of my life. And yet it made me understand so many things that were always something of a conundrum (such as why the French looked down on everything American in general but adored the Kennedy's) to the sinister goings-on of the McCarthy era (they actually burned books considered subversive in American embassies abroad, such as "works by notorious radicals like Mark Twain and Theodore Dreiser"). I got this book because I wanted to have a better understanding of why the U.S. is where it is today, and it more than filled the bill, in an all-emcompassing way. Thank you, Mr. Pells
3	4	This book is an excellent resource for Church Education staff. This book covers some basic principles (or laws as he calls them) regarding teaching in the church environment. The law of readiness is my personal favorite of the bunch, as it basicially states that both student and teacher must be prepared for the teaching environment. This is so true and often followed in higher education, but perhaps not very well followed in church education. The sad news is that typicially the teacher is blamed for the students poor scholarship or lack orf learning. But according to Henricks a student must study, must come to class on time, and must be interested in the material to proactively learn. There is much more good stuff in this book. Grab it its a great read

4	4	A wonderful portrait of the dashing, romantic Columbo. Virtually forgotten for the last half-century, Columbo was as popular as Bing Crosby in the early 1930s and considered a heart-throb on a par with actor Rudolph Valentino. But at age 26, he was shot and killed by his best friend in a freak accident, ending one of the most promising careers in music and film. Columbo was the archetypal 1930s "crooner," who gave "an impression of emotional restraint, of power in reserve." Despite the co-author credit, the book was in fact written by Lanza, a master wordsmith (and author of Elevator Music, The Cocktail, and Gravity). Penna supplied the copious archival photographs, letters and news clippings that beautifully augment the text. Lanza, who calls Columbo "an enigma wrapped inside a press release," treats his subject with respect, yet with a proper historical detachment that avoids hagiography. Columbo was as talented and charismatic as he was troubled, flawed, ambivalent, and stubborn, and Lanza makes no excuses for him. At the same time, the chronology is authoritative, and there's abundant humor, even when considering Columbo's inner torment (referring to Columbo's pet name for his adored Carole Lombard, Lanza refers to the singer's despair at not getting enough "quality Pookie time"). Lanza describing Columbo emerging from a swimming pool: "...a sight no less mythical than Venus rising from her half-shell. His dark eyes sparkled as the refracted sunlight grafted a halo around his wet hair, the water pouring like pearls of amniotic effluvia from a chlorinated incubator." Such vivid images tantalize on every page, but the book never bogs down in literary preciousness; it represents solid, well-researched journalism. Columbo's love letters to Lombard are revealing in their pathetic desperation, demonstrating that the adoration of a million wistful female fans cannot allay unrequited passion. An excellent read, and the cast of characters are richly drawn
0	4	How anyone can believe that there is a power to help people live a long life goes beyond my comprehension. This is what Estes claims in this book. What about those who live short lives? The whole book is geared at American middle-class readers who in general, even though they have college-education, are very naive. The language is that of the fairy-tale, or close to it, which suits a tv-fed and tv-indoctrinated people. Estes says that pain will clarify everything. I pained myself through her book and nothing was clarified
4	4	I'm usually dismissive of most Die Zauberflotes because I find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking. Then I came upon this recording...I have to say that it is simply the most amazing Die Zauberflote I've ever heard! The orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself...everything is mind-blowing! I'm not a Mozart person, but if I really like a recording of his I will buy it. This is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the Flute, especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera. And the Queen of the Night-Edda Moser!!! Amazing! Simply amazing! No other Queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing. This is the Flute. I would suggest Marriner's version if I hadn't seen this one, but then here is a Flute with all the greats in it! Get it now
0	1	Because she is a real-life "Wife Of," Gigi Levangie Grazer has been hailed as the "on the inside" Hollywood chick-litter. Inexplicably, it turns out, because "The Starter Wife" is full of the vapid, name-dropping superficiality that any housewife from Nebraska could dream up. Gracie is a "Wife Of" -- wealthy, toned, dyed and perfectly preserved, and married to a Hollywood heavyweight with one kid. Until Kenny hits midlife crisis -- he dresses loudly, gets an earring, and then tells Gracie that he wants a divorce. In the dizzying whirlwind of divorce, Gracie finds out that he's having an affair with Britney Spears (presumably in the months before she started slumming it with Kevin Whatsisface). A concerned pal lends Gracie her Malibu house, so the newly-divorced can get her bearings and life back on track. And as she wanders the California beaches with her gay pal and married neurotic friend, Gracie finds herself desired by not just one but two men -- a handsome homeless man, and Kenny's dissatisfied has-it-all boss. Can she become more than Kenny's "starter wife"? Okay, it has a different plot -- one that Shar Jackson might find emotional satisfaction in, admittedly. But the core of "The Starter Wife" is yet another thin plot, with a moronic heroine and lots of name-dropping. It's even worse that much of Grazer's name-dropping is out of date -- since this book went to press, Brad and Jen have broken up. So no one's worried about them procreating. Grazer's lack of inspiration shows through in the storyline itself, which meanders aimlessly between Hollywood-expose cliches and middle-aged-woman-reinvents-self cliches. The writing meanders as well, as if the author is desperately trying to fill up space. Grazer even has the excruciating taste to name Gracie's gay pal "Will." It's not witty or cute, just embarrassing. Perhaps the biggest flaw is that Gracie -- the wronged Wife Of-turned-Starter Wife -- is a pill. Despite the men going gaga over her, the supposedly smart Gracie comes across as a bitter airhead, obsessed with age even when she's feeling good about herself. Kenny is a cliche of the Selfish Ex, while Will is a cliche of the Lovable Gay Pal. Only Lou, a tired mogul who wants to know what people really think of him, comes across as a real person. With more Hollywood tale-telling and absurd cliches, Gigi Levangie Grazer slumps even further in her sophomore effort. Sure it's just a fluff book, but it's really BAD fluff
3	4	Although the book is great, it speaks for itself and I'm not here to review it. I emailed the author, or someone who works with her, at the email address I got from Jan's website. First of all, a little background. I have a two-year-old border collie/lab who I've had since he was seven weeks. I adore him. I have been working from home with the occasional temp job up until two months ago. I now work 5 days a week outside the house. I wrote to this person asking advice on certain things relating to walking the dog, and mentioned the hours my dog is being left alone while I'm at work. My response was that I am &quot;selfish&quot; and unfit to have a dog. This coming from someone who was once so clueless about raising dogs that she put one of her own to sleep. I have been looking into getting a dogwalker for my pooch, which as a person concerned for dogs, she could have suggested. But her only suggestion was my poor dog, I shouldn't have him. Whereas the book is a good read with good methods, I would suggest a second thought before asking her or her staff any questions personally. She, or whoever that was, is rather selective in the dogs she'll help according to what she thinks of their owners. It was a negative experience trying to get any kind of advice from them. Rather than pointing out something wrong and offering suggestions to rectify it to someone who is obviously open to change, she chose instead to say, Sorry! Not interested! Not at all what I had in mind for someone in her position and with her passion
0	1	This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there
0	1	I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.). Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans. Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol: COSTS Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure? First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...) Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.) ACHIEVEMENT In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids... In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools. When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student. Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races. VESTED INTERESTS It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades. Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections. Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact! Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers. HYPOCRISY A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race. Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...) I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.) I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?) What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol... (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)

3	4	Beatrice "Bede" Dunn became fascinated with wild orchids when she got a summer job with the Ontario Ministry of the Environment. They sent her to the Bruce Peninsula to map orchids. She spent three months there, wandering around the woodlands, doing some serious hiking and camping-out. When she returned in the fall with fifty rolls of film, she had a new avocation - wild orchid hunting. Bede became passionate about "documenting the existence of a single flower or the breeding ground of a particular species." In 1984 she and her boyfriend, Scott, went on a hiking holiday in the Dordogne region of southwestern France. When it began to rain, the couple had an argument about whether to leave their camp and seek shelter elsewhere or to stay put. Bede was adamant about remaining and so she did - alone. When Scott returned two days later the tent and their things were still at the campsite, but Bede was gone, along with her camera, backpack, Michelin guide and a book on wildflowers and orchids. No one ever saw the young woman again. After a massive search and investigation, which garnered much publicity, no evidence of foul play was discovered, no body, no crime scene. Mara Dunn, Bede's identical twin, has never resigned herself to the loss of her sister. She moved to the Dordogne after her divorce became final and went into the interior design business, all the while maintaining contact with the police. Nothing concrete, however, was found concerning the disappearance. During an antique hunting expedition in a near-by town, Mara discovered an old Canon camera in a pile of junk. She noticed it immediately, even though the case was mildewed and worn, because it was identical to the cameras her parents had given her and her sister for their high school graduation. She was sure it was the camera her sister had traveled to France with. Inside the case the initials "B. D." were written, and inside the camera was an undeveloped roll of film. Damaged by time and dampness, but still viable, thirty-four photographs were revealed upon development, of wild orchids and a dovecote, taken in what appears to be the local landscape. Mara is convinced the photographs document her sibling's final days. Now, almost twenty years after Bede vanished, Mara, with the photographs in hand, makes yet another effort to find her sister, or her remains. Julian Wood is an English expatriate living in Dordogne and an expert on wild orchids. He is also the author of "Wildflowers of the Dordogne/ Fleurs sauvages de la Dordogne," and the man Mara wants to assist her. She asks him to help her retrace her sister's footsteps using the photographs as a guide. Julian is skeptical about turning up anything new on the missing woman. He doesn't really want to get involved and he doesn't care much for pushy, intense women. Besides, the police have copies of the photographs and don't seem very excited by them. When Julian views the final picture though, he becomes agitated and as motivated to begin a search as Mara, but for different reasons. The photo is of a Cypripedium - Sabot de Venus in French, sometimes called Lady's Slipper in English. And since this rare wild orchid does not grow in the Dordogne, or anywhere in Europe, he has his own mystery to unravel - if he decides to become involved with Mara and her investigation. Not only is "Deadly Slipper" a good literary mystery, it is really a fun book to read. Filled with an exotic cast of characters - from the local bogeyman and his mother, who is even scarier than her son, to the bizarre Sauvignac family, (the local nobility), to Julian Wood's fanatic orchid hunting nemesis and competitor, and the regulars down at Chez Nous, the town's cafe/bar/gourmet restaurant, plus a French police inspector and his lads, these personages all enrich the narrative. The horticulture tidbits are fascinating, and I'm no gardener. The description of food, wine, the gorgeous countryside - c'est tres magnifique! The setting IS France! There is even some romancing going on in between gruesome discoveries. You cannot go wrong, especially if you're looking for something different in sleuthing. JAN
1	4	I purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children. I liked the story but the chapters were way too long. My children kept asking, "how many more pages?"
4	4	I saw this book for the very first time, while browsing through a book store in London Heathrow airport. Honestly, what caught my eyes is the name of the book. Unlike all other books I read about Hinduism, this book is very simple. I read the whole book during my flight from London to New York. This book answered all my questions I had about my culture my culture as well as my religion. I also learned so aspects of Christianity also from this book. The book also helped me to answer all type of questions my Christian friends ask me. Now when they ask me, "Why Hindus worship many gods?" I can answer them, "Hindus worship the one and only God - Brahman which express itself in many forms." When they ask me, "Why Hindus worship idols?" I can answer them, "Like every one else, including Christians, Hindus use idols or icons to concentrate on God who has no name or form." I can also tell them that Hindus believe that every person who search after truth will attain salvation [ self-realization] irrespective of whether he or she is a Hindu or Christian or Moslem. Am I A Hindu? is indeed a book for Indians born in the west who are desperately trying to learn about their faith. In short, AM I A HINDU? Is a great book for anyone who wants to know everything about Hinduism. An amazing book without any dogma or demagoguery.
1	4	This is a fine book if you want to see what someone very smart has to say about Machiavelli's major works. What I wanted, however, was to understand the context in which Machiavelli wrote, and I would have loved to get some information on how and why his ideas began to have influence beyond Florence. If you understand references to the founding of Rome, to 15th century Papal politics, and have a good grounding in Livy, this book is for you. If, like me, what you wanted from a introduction to Machiavelli was to have someone explain Machiavelli's context and allusions, look elsewhere
0	3	This book was disappointing because it was billed as a raw cookbook and it is not raw. Get Juliano's "Raw" and "Rawsome" by Bridgette Mars and "Green for Life" by Victoria Botenko instead
3	4	This is not a typical read for me, but I enjoyed it. I read the first 148 pages wondering if this was going to be a waste of time, but when I hit chapter 44, I read the rest of the book in one sitting. Loved Max, Frannie, Kit & all the others. Looking forward to reading "The Lake House"
1	4	Since the end of the Cold War and the virtual eradication of the two other great political ideologies of the twentieth century, namely Communism and Fascism, the victory of Capitalism has earned it the right to proceed unmolested and, to a very great degree, unquestioned in its dissemination to every point on the globe. This, as Samir Amin author of The Liberal Virus aptly points out, could be dangerous. Capitalism is a system that has always been based on the Darwinian principal of survival of the fittest and as such "can produce nothing other than an intensification of the inequalities between people." True. So true. And anybody who takes the time to actually study Adam Smith's, The Wealth of Nations, will see that the twin engines supposed to drive a Capitalist economy are greed and competition, with very little regard for the actual well being of humans. This should come as no surprise, as a quick look around at the current champions of Capitalist enterprise in America like insurance, energy and telecommunications will readily reveal. Any thinking person must agree that it is at least worthwhile to keep a cautious eye on the current trajectory of unfettered Capitalism, and inquiring into its possible dangers is undoubtedly healthy. In fact, what's needed is a measured evaluation of Capitalism as it exists today, both good and bad, with the kind of unflinching exploration into its darker implications provided by Samir Amin here. But in the current American political climate where knee-jerk Conservatism hold sways and the petty ranting of narrow-minded demagogues is counted as reasoned political discourse, this is no time to inject an analysis of Capitalism with anti-Americanism and hand-wringing over the demise of Socialism. A book like this advances the issue with only the most restrained and open-minded readers and, for the rest, drags the debate back into the muck of Cold War hysterics. Not only does Amin reveal himself as a whiney, vindictive Socialist who would love nothing more than to see America brought to its knees, but he is an obtuse and turgid writer of the kind only academia can produce. There were sentences in this book I had to read three times before I could figure out what he was saying, and his annoying habit of loading his sentences with digressive clauses, parenthetical clarifications and coined words, had me grateful that this book was only 112 pages long - I have read 300 page books that took me less time to get a handle on. All in all, The Liberal Virus explores some issues much in need of inquiry but does so in a way that is so off-putting that it cannot gain much traction among American readers, no matter what their stripe, and can only serve to hinder the debate. What we need is a book about Capitalism that can open minds, not scare them closed or befuddle them with the liberal self-indulgence of its author.
3	4	I hightly recommend this book. An easy, quick read that could change your life
1	4	Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun
0	1	A ferocious beast that loves Mickey Mouse? Capable of ripping two armed policemen to shreds? Capable of eluding the Marines in the wilderness? All these talents and the final encounter with this terrible monster is so anticlimatic it made me resent having wasted my time with the novel. And the ending . . . . horrible. It was as if Koontz thought the audience of this novel would be teenagers looking for something like R.L. Stine would write. I'd give it a half a star if I could
4	4	Although many readers have commented on Elizabeth (a truly captivating character), her husband Isaac has been given short shift. He appears in one of the book's most poignant scenes as he straightens up after the Rosh Hashana dinner and, in an act of private accounting, chastises himself for his reluctance to support his wife in her desire to open a store. Analyzing his failings with the same critical eye he might bring to a scholarly text, Isaac then resolves to mend his ways. This scene is almost unsurpassed in its portrayal of a tender and intensely religious Jewish sensibility (surpassed, in my reading, only by Chaim Grade in the closing section of the second novella in his magnificant "Rabbis and Wives").
1	4	Being a big fan of Grant's unique guitar playing, I've always wanted to know a bit more about the man behind the music. As far as I know, this is the only book about him. The book doesn't go into a great amount of detail. The discography and selected reviews are worth reading. I'd say your best bet to understanding Grant Green would be to spend the money you would plunk down on this book on a good CD of his- Idle Moments, Green Street, The Complete Quartets with Sonny Clark. Then you can really get your money's worth..
0	1	...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it.
3	4	It is a great book for young ones to learn about Shapes. My 13 months old son is not in to shapes yet but I will use this book onces he learns about shapes. Buy this book if your toddler already can recognize the shapes and can sit with you while you read this book. It is a activity book.
0	1	I picked up this book read the reviews on the cover and was up for a funny book. The book was anything but funny. I read about half, up to the point where he was in a mental institution and could not read anymore. I consider myself fairly liberal but this was too over the top for me. The graphic details of his homosexual love affair with a 33 yr. old was just sick. I am not sure where this belongs as a novel or a memoir but I had to throw it away because I did not want my children to get a hold of it. I found the whole thing disturbing and failed to see the humor in these sick, mentally ill characters. I started hating them for the abuse they put their children through
4	4	The successful companies are not afraid to confront the problem when it arises and discuss it rationally. Even though directed more toward a business or office atmosphere, the same techniques can be applied to family and friends. The example stories cover a broad array of possible circumstances, which will help when conversations turn crucial (or critical). The chapters flow well, with a touch of humor. The skills can be easily learned. Chapters 1-2 are an introduction; Chapters 3-9 details how to use each skill; Chapters 10-12 is a summary and contains advanced study tools. The authors believe good communication skills (talking, listening and acting together) start with the heart. To some these skills may seam obvious, but they are also meant to boost or to rid ourselves of years of bad habits. They will then become more conscience as practiced. First is to recognize we need this book. Then we need to utilize it and build our communication skills to make them habits. I believe it is safe to say that most who pick this book up will come away with an improvement in some area. "To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often" --- Winston Churchil
4	4	With the multitude of books written regarding the sport of baseball, Steven Travers writes with a unique insight into not only the sport, but the day to day lives of Bonds and his peers. As a former professional baseball player, Travers touches on the subject matter with a unique insight and perspective. Additionally, Travers attended and graduated from USC during the time Bonds played at Arizona State (Pac-10). As such, Travers is not only a writer, but a fan. Travers not only documents Bond's achievement of becoming baseball's all-time single season homerun champion, but he touches on Bond's trials and tribulations with his peers and the media. Ultimately, the reader soon realizes that Travers was able to do what many has tried and failed at; that is, he was able to garner the respect and support of Bonds in the ability to tell his amazing story to the whole world. As a former Pac-10 pitcher at USC who battled Bonds on many occasions, I found Traver's insight very refreshing and commendable. I found the book a very easy read that kept me entertained throughout.

4	4	Henry Fielding wrote SHAMELA for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. The fact that Richardson's earlier PAMELA had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. In his preface, Fielding makes it clear that he has placed Richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. He attempts to expose "the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela, Are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless Arts of that young Politician, set in a true and just Light." He makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether Pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary Fielding sees as the latter. Like PAMELA, SHAMELA is a novel (much briefer than PAMELA) written as letters. But in Fielding's hands, Shamela is seen as the master manipulator. Where Pamela faints whenever her Mr. B. grabs her, Shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. With each passing episode, Fielding inverts the moral universe of Richardson so that when one considers Richardson's subtitle of PAMELA as "Virtue rewarded," one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of Pamela and the virtue of Shamela are alike only in their spelling. I am glad that I read PAMELA first, for if I had come across SHAMELA first, I am pretty sure that I would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic.
1	1	I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that
4	4	This will appeal to many people, from history buffs to health professionals and those of us who also love a good story. Myself, I always enjoy the human behavior aspect to how things came to be in our society, and the story of vaccination is terrific. Aside from the fun aspect of this book, Mr. Allen manages to write compassionately about the real people who have believed that their children's autism was caused by vaccines. There has been so much propaganda and spurious argumentation around this issue (particularly by people like Don Imus--he should be ashamed of himself), which has unfortunately lead many parents of children with autism to believe that vaccination caused their child's disability. I hope very much that Mr. Allen's work will help shine the light of reason on that sad situation
0	3	Lots of data, but the story to tell seems to have never been found. The findings are really not that interesting
1	1	The content of this book is adequate, but the layout leaves much to be desired. The only way to find a chapter is through the table of contents. Pages are not labeled with chapter information, such as which chapter that page belongs to. The content is often broken up with cases and excercises that divide paragraphs in half. This makes it very confusing to follow the flow of the book. You can be reading along and jump into a case or excercise without knowing it and become very confused. If the authors and publishers would rework the flow of the book, I would rate it much higher
3	1	Unlike the first Repairman Jack adventure, THE TOMB, which was horror/science fiction, this one is a straight mystery. Wilson does try his best to shamelessly tug at your heartstrings, tossing in some abandoned babies with AIDS, and also some child pornography. Add a modern-day Japanese samuri, some American mercenaries, some Arab villains, and you've got is a fast-paced novel that could be made into a pretty good movie
3	4	This is a wonderfully written book. There is a section for every person to find something of interest. There are several new things to learn here. It is written in a very mature fashion and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable whatever your reading about
0	1	After hearing some decent things about this book, I was surprised at just how uninteresting and often offensive of a read it turned out to be. Marlowe is accurate in some of her depictions of heroin use in the East Village of New York and way off base in others. I chalk this up to everyone's experiences being different (however, I certainly don't think a one-bag-a-day habit with weeks off in between makes her an authority on addiction by any stretch of the imagination). What I don't understand is why she felt the need to go into such great detail about her rather boring life between her discussions of the dope world. Most of her anecdotes had little to no bearing on the story she was trying to tell and were mind-numbingly dull. I found her narrative to be very disjointed and incoherent. But what I found most repugnant was her better-than-thou attitude towards those of a lower class or darker skin tone (e.g. assuming dark-skinned men who didn't think to aspire to become more than security guards must not have gotten support or affirmation in their homes growing up, like she did). She herself says that she became interested in street-life and street people in order to increase her "coolness" factor. Sure she dabbled in drug use and in the East Village culture, but that does not make her an authority, and she does not paint a very true portrait of either. If you want a good portrayal of street life and heroin use from the inside, read Seth Morgan's Homeboy. If you want elitist drivel, this book should do the trick
3	1	This is essentially a grammar, but it leaves out the simple basics and continues where a school grammar would stop. It assumes that you master the hiragana and katagana alphabets, but for the kanji there is almost always a pronounciation guide. It takes time to read, as the text is concentrated, but it's not difficult, and one gladly reads one chapter after the other. Generally it's both interesting and useful
1	3	This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences. That's about all it is. Pretty, well constructed sentences. The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake. The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered. At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told.
0	1	Could not get in to story, jumped around so much, worse book I have tried to read
0	1	Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed
4	4	Ivan Lansberg's new book is an excellent resource for anyone living through, or helping to manage, the succession process in a family business! The book is thoroughly scholarly yet practical...it is &quot;a must read,&quot; for anyone interested in the subject. It is the best book on the subject I have read
1	4	In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack. In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip. "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him. Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had. Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications. This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling. But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe: 1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result. 2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by. 3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar. 4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices. This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean: "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32) "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91) "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97) "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110) "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123) In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book. Rennie Petersen PS. Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul)
0	4	I love to read, and have all my life. I don't know how I escaped reading "Mary Poppins" as a child, because I read nearly every other children's classic book. I decided to read this aloud to my children precisely because I hadn't read it. I was horrified as the book went on...if this Mary has a heart, I can't find it. You'd have to use a microscope to find it. Yes, there are strange adventures that are interesting. I don't have a problem with that. My problem is Mary herself. She's nasty and mean, and there isn't one redeeming quality about her in the book. I found myself disliking her more and more as the book went on. Perhaps I was tainted in my viewpoint by the Disney version. But I'll gladly take that version, for once, over the book. At least in the movie Mary could crack a smile and actually enjoy something. In the book she's as friendly as a block of ice. Watch the movie. Forget the book

0	4	I personally believe Dr. Dyson has the best interest of black folk at heart. I really do. However, I think he is misguided and I am not impressed by him. I admit I did not finish the book. Once he began his personal attacks on Mr. Cosby I left it alone. Bill said what many of us say in private. Period. You can argue that he picked the wrong time and place, but the message is the right one. Maybe he did not say it as nicely as he could have, but it is still the truth. At the end of the day there are way too many writers and speakers trying to pass themselves off as leaders. Leaders lead, writers write, and speakers talk. The sad thing about it is so many of our people incorrectly accept these people as leaders. There are too many people trying to tell us what to think and not enough showing our people what to do. While Dyson beats Cosby down personally I ask what should some of these young brothers do to better their situation? There are basically two kinds of people in this world. You either look for people and things that confirm what you think to be true. Or you look for people and things that will reveal the truth rather it confirms what you thought or turns it on its head. At this time our people need the truth, not more pandering.
3	4	I found this book to be very well written and easy to understand, for the most part the book will take you by the hand in modeling a character (using 3Ds Max 3). If you are a total newbie you will find this book easy to comprehend and follow wish in my opinion will set some foundation for you if you wish to buy and read more advanced books on the subject. On the downsize the book does a little attempt to explain texturing a character and doesn't go in deep in the process of designing the textures of the characters. But all in all a pretty nice book for entry level character design
0	1	I found that if you want to learn the language of auditing, have another reference handy. Often, the discourse goes on and on and on and could really be distilled down into a sentence or two that had a firm and grounded presentation. There were very few examples so it was difficult at best to try to understand the often high-level conceptual frameworks that were constantly being presented. I also noted quite a few editing errors that probably arose from cut-and-pastes that were not carefully reviewed. Also, figures and diagrams were reused and were not carefully reviewed either as information was present that didn't apply to the new scenario
4	4	I recently discovered I have multiple food allergies. This cookbook has been extremely useful. I have tried about a dozen recipes in the past 3 weeks. All recipes have turned out well, and have been very tasty. I would recommend this cookbook to other allergy sufferers. I found the sections on the different flours and how to rotate my diet very useful
1	4	I have recently completed reading BabyWise II. I consider myself a Christian and this book is extremely popular in my church. Throughout the entire book, I had moments of complete confusion and disagreement accompanied by moments of complete agreement and lucidity regarding how to implement these methods. However, by the end, I realized that I should not be confused by or passionately against any section of a book that would truly benefit my child. While I believe there are some helpful and necessary methods in the book, I had already found much of that advice in other sources. For example, feeding schedules are advocated by many resources, but those other sources are very clear when it comes to making sure babies' basic needs are met before implementing such routines. With my knowledge from other resources, I attempted to read BabyWise with a bit of grace, but at the same time I felt guilt and coercement at many points; for instance, when I realized that my child was having one more meal a day than what is 'recommended' by Mr. Ezzo for a child her age. For the record, my pediatrician generally recommends one more meal than she is receiving for a child her age. This concern and my confusion on other subjects in the book prompted me to speak to my husband about the book and I asked him to read it. He read only the forward and immediately became suspicious. He asked me if there were any references and I instantly realized there were none. It then became clear that the pediatrician listed as an author indeed had no authorship save the foreword, and that Mr. Ezzo has had no formal education regarding child development. A very quick search on the internet confirmed our deductions, and we found many articles against Mr. Ezzo's methods, including a well documented student's masters thesis. Out of curiosity and still trying to find a way to defend this popular book, I performed internet searches on all of the other resources on child development we own (four books; all of which document research for their claims and advice) and found absolutely no negative press for any. Based on how unclear I found the teachings in the book and how much bad advice I had to sort out, I strongly urge anybody who reads this book to read other books first. As I said, I don't disagree with all of the methods and advice, but it should be seen as advice from a person who has raised obedient (not a bad thing) children and has no other qualifications beyond that. You could do just as well asking advice from a friend or acquaintence with children who possess qualities you admire. As we all know every child is different and reacts to different discipline methods differently. Please make sure you go to many resources to find the option best suited to your child. Just an end note: As popular as this book is among my friends, I have not known anybody to follow the BabyWise book beyond feeding schedules and sleeping issues, and there is a good reason for that: Not all of it is good advice
0	1	If you read this book -- you can thank the author for making you dumber. If you spent money on this book -- you can thank the author for wasting your hard-earned cash. If you enjoyed this book in any respect -- then you can thank the author for her talent in writing fiction. Not only was this book chock full of crap, it didn't at all confer with the people involved to get the facts straight. This is all hearsay and press coverage that anyone could dig up googling the subject matter. Now, if you believe what the press tells you -- then you're a real sucker
4	4	This is an unbelievably great edition of The Canterbury Tales. All I wanted was the original, complete version with definitions for archaic words. But the Penguin Classics edition was all I could find, so I got it. It comes with over 500 pages of extras!!! Super-detailed notes, a great glossary, and lots on Chaucer, his times, literary genres, etc., etc. Multiple interpretations are given for parts scholars don't agree on. I can't believe I paid $80 for the Riverside Chaucer in college! ...which I later sold back for much less. This edition blew me away, and it's relatively cheap. If you haven't read Chaucer and want to read him in old English, it's tough at first, but it gets easier with practice. There are long tales, short tales, noble tales, bawdy tales, etc. If you just want to read a few, there are cheaper paperbacks with just a few. If you want the complete tales but not the essays and things, they exist, but they're more expensive than this edition
4	4	This book is not a history in the since of most history books. It does not detail how the academy began, or how it changed over the years, or give you any kind of insider view of its workings. Instead, it is a complete listing of every nominee and every winner in every category since the award ceremony's inception in 1927. There are plenty of photographs of the nominees and images of scenes from the nominated films for each year, so it is not dry in the way many reference books are. In fact, Mr. Osborne's love of film and its history really shine through in the book. It is interesting to look through this book and see what we consider to be films that have withstood the test of time versus which ones were rewarded by the academy at the time. For example, in 1939, the Academy did recognize that "Gone with the Wind" was the best picture of the year, which people were lining up to watch in movie theaters until its television broadcast premiere in 1976. However, in 1941, "How Green was My Valley" won best picture, which is a film that hardly anyone watches anymore, while "Citizen Kane" was completely ignored. It's also interesting to see how the Academy compensated for past oversights by awarding performances that were less than stellar in subsequent years. For instance, in 1934 Bette Davis was overlooked in her performance in "Of Human Bondage". This caused a huge public outcry. The following year the Academy gave her the best actress award for her performance in "Dangerous"- a move that has largely been seen over the years as a consolation prize for what happened the year before. This book is full of little insights such as these, and it is a fun book that gives hours of entertainment for film history buffs. I bought my first copy of this history by Mr. Osborne back in 1987 when he was then detailing the 60 years of the Oscar, and I enjoyed it so much I have been updating my copy every time he releases a new edition. Highly recommended
4	4	A wonderful story of devotion! Mem Fox continues to be one of my favorite children's story tellers. Hunwick is a sweet little creature who remains loyal in spite of others' misgivings. The use of so many animals strange to the Americas makes the book even more wonderful, with delightful pictures to help with the story
4	4	How could I have missed HUNWICK until now? He is a rabbit-eared Bandicoot, one of an endangered species, familiarly known in Australia as the BILBY. *Aussie* reviewer "LIN" won me over by suggesting that "Hunwick's Egg" would be a great Easter gift. Hunwick and his mysterious egg become very special friends but the egg does not hatch. They are scrutinized by a collection of the weirdest animals you ever yearned to hug: a cockatoo, an echidna (resembling a porcupine), and the hairiest of emus who could benefit from a bit of *Bryll Cream* . . . Hunwick is all heart and reaches out to readers with the most irresistible eyes to ever appear on your radar screen! But still the egg does not hatch. The plant life is gorgeous, drawn ever so delicately in watercolor pencils. I am most captivated by a plant resembling the eucalyptus, and other green wildflowers. After referring to my dictionary I felt tricked into falling for a RAT, of all things. I don't want to believe what my faithful reference says about this darling creature! The more important reality is that HAPPINESS CAN ERUPT FROM THE MOST UNEXPECTED OF RELATIONSHIPS. It is remarkable how loneliness vanishes when you can share your burrow. Reviewer mcHAIKU recommends that you make sure you have an Easter Basket large enough to accommodate this precious book
3	4	IMPERIAL WOMAN is the fictionalized biography of the great Dowager Empress Tzu Hsi, the real power behind the throne during the reins of the last four emperors of China. The story starts with her as a beautiful Manchu teenager who, along with her cousin Sakota, is picked for the emperor's crop of concubines. Through guile and ambition, Tzu Hsi bears the male heir to the emperor she comes to control. When the emperor dies young, Tzu Hsi makes sure she and Sakota are named regents for the young child emperor. Through keen intelligence, intrigue, and whatever other means necessary, Tzu Hsi holds the imperial throne through her son's childhood. Buck portrays a woman split between feelings of love for her family and what is the best for the empire, rather than what I gather is the historical feeling - that Tzu Hsi was some sort of evil spider spinning schemes from the center of her web in Forbidden City. Through all the machinations and years she is aided by Jung Lu, her former betrothed and the love of her life. The Dowager Empress has the ultimate power, but Buck shows she is a servant of the opinions of her court advisors and in reality only rules the eunuchs and court ladies in the Forbidden City. She is a relic of the past in a time of great change and cultural upheaval in China, when it is besieged by western nations and ideas. The infamous Boxer Rebellion is the beginning of the end for Tzu Hsi, and she loses her spirit and resolve after this defeat and the death of her beloved Jung Lu.
1	3	I thoroughly enjoyed reading Nancy's book, and it sounded as though it would be the perfect answer for my fitting problems. But, when I tried to utilize her techniques, nothing fit at all. It was a big disappointment
4	4	Having studied the work of Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI) and read more than half-a-dozen works on him, I came to "God's Choice" with a significant cache of knowledge on the subject. While Weigel's work and social commentary (perhaps best known through his syndicated column) remains a source of contention and, at times, controversy, I was rather pleased with this book. I believe that the major fault of the work rests in the initial focus on John Paul II (which occupies more than 100 pages of the 268-page book). Like David Gibson in his "The Rule of Benedict," Weigel apparently felt it necessary to remind the reader of all the great details of Benedict's predecessor - a task I find to be superfluous. That said, it is a good book. I was delightfully surprised at times while reading this book to find that Weigel had occasionally rendered his advisories an appropriate level of respect. Citing John Allen, Jr., (chief Vatican correspondent for National Catholic Reporter, often noted by being at ends ideologically with the views of Weigel) and others, Weigel significantly avoids polemical spin in a way that has garnered new respect from this reader. However, it should also be noted that there remains a peppering of Weigel's clear and present agenda throughout the book. While at times is appears fleeting or subtle, reader beware that his ecclesial and cultural politics surface here and there. Perhaps one example would suffice. While addressing his opinion of a "progressive Catholic movement" and its possible Cardinal-elector representatives, he makes the unfounded and impertinent remark: "That, in turn, may explain why the progressive project is infertile - increasingly unable to attract the brightest students in graduate schools of theology in the United States." (Weigel 136-137) Without any substance, using vague terms, Weigel makes a sweeping statement regarding the state of graduate theological students - as it pleases him. All in all, this is a wonderfully written work. Weigel is clearly intelligent, while politically transparent, and his writing style engages the reader. I would recommend this book as a companion volume to the many other works dedicated to elucidating the life and work of Benedict XVI (see John Allen, Jr.'s "Pope Benedict XVI," H. J. Fischer's "Pope Benedict XVI: A Personal Portrait," and Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger's "Milestones.")
0	4	I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy. Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined. With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects. Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks. At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is. I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects. I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made. The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest. We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house. Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling.
0	1	The Professional Edition appears to be missing any information on at least 2 new Photoshop CS2 features; Smart Sharpening and Reduce Noise. It has sections on Sharpening and Noise BUT does not cover the new CS2 commands. I have not been through the whole book but this situation took me by surprise
4	4	This was the first Nora Roberts book that I had read and it is now, I think, my most favorite book I have ever read. I have never been interested in reading a romance before, but this struck me as being different and it was! It has romance in it difinately...very good romance I might add...but it is a thriller! I couldn't put it down and I'm not kidding! I read this book in a week and it normally takes me close to a month because I just don't have that much time to read. I found my self MAKING time to read THIS book! It is very graphic with the murders, rapes and animal killings, but reading that kind of stuff doesn't really bother me. It's seeing it in a movie that I can't handle. But I think Nora Roberts knew what she was doing by making it so graphic. You just want to KILL this guy, and you find yourself prying your eyes open even when your exhausted and want to go to bed just to see if maybe on the next page you figure out who this guy is. Not only is the suspense awsome, but her characters are great. You just really get involved with them and really feel what they feel. I loved reading about the girls learning to run a ranch, ride horses, and heard cattle and stuff like that. Everything about the book is just awsome!
4	4	This book was required reading at our office and at the time I wondered why, after all we had a great team! After taking the assessment test I realized we had lots of room to improve! The story was a quick and easy read but very effective. We implemented many of the ideas in the book and work much more effectively today than we did a year ago. Thanks for a great book
1	4	The story is quite clunky and contrived, and yet, I still can't help but feel some affection for it, as, despite my opinions of Mr. Roeder's talents, he clearly feels deeply for his characters, and their none-to-realistic world. The good things are here--while the characters are cardboard cut-outs, and the fact that the two couples are essentially dopplegangers, their plight is still quite a bit involving. My negatives, though, really spring from the way the plot unfolds--far too quickly and far too coincidental. I know that the chamber of horrors at the "mental hospital" is not far removed from reality, but for a lot of the story, the amazing circumstances that abound in the novel are a bit too much to bear. And I can't quite parse the way Mr. Roeder attempts to ground his characters in a realistic setting, and then throws on paranormal experiences. As escapist literature, I've read worse, but for something that seems to be striving towards realism, I just don't know
4	4	Insightful critique of the Qur'an and related materials on Mohammad and Islamic history, current events, and terrorism. A introductory work of great breadth. A must read, for more than purposes of Christian evangelism. For those who want to preserve the West

4	4	Tempting Tropicals is a horticultural tour de force, packed with detailed information about growth habits, propagation tips, and the soil, temperature and light requirements of more than eight score tropical plants. The fascinating, well written text is ornamented with full color photographs of these exotic beauties that marvelously display each plant's unique attributes. The superb text and photos are presented with the exacting production values that the publisher is well known for in the gardening community. This book is a must for all real phytophiles

1	4	There are some good hints here, but do not be mislead by the title. For a complete book on Disneyland and California Adventure, I highly recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003, Expert Advice From The Inside Source. Birnbaum's Disneyland is updated annually and published every year
0	4	This may be a bit of spoiler but I was completly dissappointed in the end of this book/trilogy. I could not understand how she was going to wrap up so many story lines in last few pages of the book and then I learned. I felt I was reading the end of a story witten by a parent trying to rush their children to bed. After three books I had invested a great deal of time into these characters and story lines. To wrap them up so hasty, with such outragouse coincidence and neatness did not do justice to what otherwise was a very thoughtful series of books.
1	4	The subtitle of this book, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa, is completely deceitful. There is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists. It is rather a chronicle of the Japanese film industry, not without interest in itself. However, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading. While the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources. Meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of Kurosawa and Mifune. The author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself. A simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book
0	1	This book is pretty near worthless. I started reading it knowing that I was unlikely to agree with much of Vicki's "advice," but I thought it still might be funny. It wasn't. Also, lots of her advice is not only wrong it is *completely* wrong--as in, not only not backed up by evidence, but actually *contraindicated* by evidence. I could not even finish reading the book after I got to the complete drivel that was her "advice" on infant feeding--she presented the section as "common considerations when deciding to breastfeed" and then proceeded to describe the absolute worst-case-scenario for everything possibly related to breastfeeding (& several things that can't be blamed on breastfeeding at all!). It was a common considerations section, but would have been more aptly named, "reasons I think breastfeeding is awful and no one should do it" section. I think it is valuable for women to read books that present a less-than-rosy view of motherhood, because too often we have a strong and persistent "perfect mother" image in our heads that is very difficult to live up to (especially if we have perfectionistic tendencies). I adore real-life, tell-it-like it is motherhood memoirs--they are validating and supportive. This book, however, is overwhelming negative and baby-bashing. There are much, much better books out there that do not worship motherhood, but do not completely despise it either
1	1	If you are that "Dummy" who wants to know how to build a web-site, then this is not the book for you. It tells you hardly how to build, it tells more about links which can help you making your web-site look more cool. You have to have some HTML cq Dreamweaver experience to understand the context of what the writer wants to clarify. By reading the book and going through the enclosed CD Rom with ty-out software, I soon came to the conclusion that the title of the book is somewhat misleading. See comments above why. If you are that "Dummy" who has not a single thread of knowledge about building web-sites, then do NOT buy this book. Not giving it 1 star (but I was close), there are some interesting chapters in this reference giude, but typing what you want to have inside your web-site (links and related web-sites with loads of info what comprises around 50% of the book). you will get the same information from any search engine. Recommendation: concentrate first on a book, that teaches you the basic HTML-programming language, continue then with either a Dreamweaver/FrontPage manual. You're much better off..
0	1	Maybe this book contains some good advice. But I gave it a low rating because you have to wade through so much fluff to find it. I seriously doubt I'll make it all the way through the book. The first part of the book talks about Michael Gerber's (fictitious?) mentee Sarah, a previous client of his who has apparently fallen and can't get up. The conversations between Michael and Sarah are so contrived and syrupy, who can believe them? Sarah needs to climb a mountain in Nepal, discover the meaning of life, and get it over with. The second part, which I'm reading now, is structured around the 7 "disciplines" for building a company. I skipped ahead to this part, but it refers back to so much of the fluff in the first part that I really feel lost not having read it. If you like business story books of the Patrick Lencioni variety, you MIGHT get something out of E Myth Mastery. But be warned: This book as many times longer than Lencioni's, with a lot less meat
1	4	This book could be a great book for the unergrad intro to structures course. It has a nice writing style, it is easy to understand, and has plenty of example problems. However, it is FULL of errors. It think someone in my class would find a new error at least once a week
1	3	I felt that the Tamara Hayle mysteries are all missing that at-the-edge-of-my-seat suspense that is required in mysteries. I couldn't care less about the characters, and the outcome was predictable

0	4	My daughter's kindergarten teacher read this book to them in class today and they also made an adorable craft of the old lady with cut outs of all of the animals which fit into her apron. I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge. Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song. I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time. Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real she still was upset for the rest of the night. I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it. I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it. I know that there are a few children in her class who have lost grandparents this year and it just seems like maybe this book could bring up sad feelings for them as well
0	1	There have been a dozen or more &quot;boy's books&quot; lately, most notably the exceptional Raising Cain, by Kindlon and Thompson. Most of them are not worth the bother, and this compendium is at the top of that list

4	4	I used to be a good friend to Rush. I listened to his program all the time. When I first saw this book, I ignored it. Finally, after it had been in the window of our bookstore for several months, I picked it up and looked inside. I was amazed! However, I had to put it down because I thought it was too negative. It called Rush names. I did not need to have that. Finally, I tried getting it at the library, but they said they did not have a copy, because they said it was "too controversial." So when the price came down, I bought a used copy for a couple of bucks, and read the whole thing. I was amazed some more! Rush used to have 20 million listeners to his talk show. He was a legendary, rich talk show host. This book tells you exactly how Rush became a rich, popular talk show host. And he is thinner now that he has recovered from his unfortunate drug problem. And you know, that sort of thing could happen to anybody. But I had trusted Rush, and his VALUES, and I kind of felt he let me down. So for me, the title is not appropriate. Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Rich Talk Show Host who Cuts Corners on His Values would be a better title. Rush is no idiot, either. Now, by some "coincidence" Al Franken is a talk show host too. And, I bet he learned how by studying how Rush did it! If Franken can do it, YOU can do it! Don't miss out on this GREAT opportunity! Get a copy. Look how cheap it is now. Tell your friends
1	4	This is a nearly verbatim rendition of the Grimms' story, and it's hard to understand why Zelinsky would use his talent to illustrate it for children. Even harder to figure out is how the American Library Association could award its Caldecott Medal for distinguished American picture book for children to any rendition of this dreadful tale: The king threatens to kill the miller's daughter if she can't spin gold from straw. Rumpelstiltskin saves her life by spinning gold for her, but extracts a necklace, a ring and, on the third night of spinning, a promise of her firstborn. She then marries the king, whom Zelinsky depicts as young and handsome. When it comes time for the queen to hand over her newborn, Rumpel agrees to relent if the queen can discover his name. She sends a servant to follow him into the woods and discover the name. So the king, though he looks good, is greedy and brutal. The queen is a victim who agrees to give over a future infant to save her own life, and then depends on an anonymous, unrecognized "servant girl" to save the child. And Rumpelstiltskin, shown as physically unattractive and (the message seems to be) therefore bad, is the one who saved the future queen from execution and then relents on the payment he bargained for. A weird, twisted story that offers nothing for kids, illustrated with Renaissance-style pictures that accentuate the perversity by making the bad guy look good and the guy who saved the damsel in distress look bad

3	1	One only need read the reviews of this book from both professional and amateur critics to see that, if Gross's purpose is to aid the reconciliation between Jews and Poles, he has utterly failed. Unlike books dealing with heroes who surmounted prejudice to create miracles, this book stirs an old cauldron of hatred, freshening the pot. Readers without a more complete history of both the Jews and the Poles are especially at risk. Jan Karski's "Story of a Secret State" which was actually written DURING World War 2 and deals with the situation in a balanced and informed manner would be a good companion book to this. Additional reading should include a comprehensive review of Polish-Jewish relations, beginning with the Charters of Sanctity responsible for so many Jews living in Poland in the first place. When Jews were being blamed for the plague and slaughtered throughout Europe, the Poles opened their doors and gave them a homeland, where they thrived for many centuries. The Lutheran armies of the Swedish invasions brought anti-Semitism. Later, Poland was divided by Germany, Russia (with a German Queen), and Austria, an occupation which lasted for more than a century. These countries waged a cultural war on the occupied Poles, determined to convert them to their own. The Poland of WW2 had only been liberated for a few decades. The equivalent of Ronald Reagan's era to today. Many of the citizens were of German descent and actually aided the Nazis in their fight against other Poles, not only Jews. And although the sickening atrocities recounted in this book are inexcusable, one must keep in mind that they were committed by people driven to collective madness by decades of oppression, poverty and terror. We've seen similar episodes in recent years in the Balkans and Africa and elsewhere. Even the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem maintains a website decrying violations by hate-infected Israelis today. Poland has only regained her true national and cultural identity in the last two decades, after two hundred years of occupation. Pope John Paul 2 was emblematic of that spirit, and Poland's support for Israel and attempts to honor her Jewish heritage, embraced by her youth of today, are evidence that she has turned a corner and is nurturing the great ideals of her past. The Poland that was once a mighty power, yet never imperialistic. The Poland that was the Promised Land for Jews in the Middle Ages

1	1	ALthough this is text for an introductory course of management, this is inappropriate material for the novice or inexperienced potential manager. Recommended only for people familiar with business-speak and several years in the field of management
4	4	This is an excellent and accurate account of a horse that learned to spell and do simple math. It is also an amazing story of the emancipated slave who trained him. It gives an excellent history of the time after the civil war. It changed my view of what is possible. I was taught in psychology 101 that the horse Gentle Hans was a fraud and that he had learned to pick up unconscious cues from his trainer, that he wasn't really able to think. Beautiful Jim Key proved without a doubt that he was able to spell and do math and make change. Wonderful history
3	4	When I first discovered that a new Burton biography by a professor of history was soon to be published I had high expectations. Upon receipt of Professor Kennedy's Burton biography titled The Highly Civilized Man, I started digesting his work. The asserted themes of the work included 1) placing Burton and his work in context with the larger issues and challenges of Victorian times, and 2) using Burton to better understand the nature of changes beginning to percolate socially due to the interaction of Victorian England with its colonial enterprises. Indeed, as far as I know, this approach is pioneering and insightful. As I continued reading to about page 90, I thought Professor Kennedy's effort was well done, and the book would be another jewel to adorn the crown of Burton research, along with the work of Mary Lovell. I am of the opinion Professor Kennedy succeeded in achieving both this stated objectives. From this standpoint, his book is a success. The observations of Burton as a harbinger bridging the transition from the Victorian Era to the Modern Era reflect the type of insights one expects from a biographer trained in the rigors of academic scholarship. I enjoyed the in depth academic analysis of Burton from the standpoint of concepts of relativism as applied to notions of cultural difference. Professor Kennedy has also highlighted the role played by Burton in the early development of anthropology as an academic discipline. Social/Cultural Anthropology's primary research methodology is called participant/observation. Certainly, this approach was an inherent part of Burton's nature, and the scope of his anthropological observations were derived by this research approach. I was also glad to see that Professor Kennedy gave particular attention to discussing Burton's Stone Talk and his Kasidah. The earlier biographies did not devote much attention to either of these important works. As long as Kennedy stayed focused on academic based scholarship he avoided the pitfalls that plagued the earlier biographies that predated Lovell's Rage to Live. Unfortunately, the book digressed into complicated histories that are not fully recounted. Yet, Professor Kennedy felt compelled to make several definitive conclusions sorely lacking the professional level of scholarship a professor should be required to meet. The outcome of Kennedy's failures is a setback in Burton scholarship. Given the effort to place Burton in context, the irony is that the book with notable examples omits necessary context to understand and evaluate some of the Professor's conclusion. For example, the recounted history of Burton firing over the head of a crowd of Greek Orthodox Christians fails to acknowledge that Burton resorted to this solution after trying less violent alternatives, and after he and fellow members of his party were injured by rocks thrown at them. The key point is that Burton used a hierarchy of options to confront unstable situations. This point also relates to the absurd conclusion that Richard and Isabel were role-playing in the desert, and that there is a hidden psychology to uncover. The decision to have Isabel act as Richard's son was an attempt to protect her from rape and death, and to give Richard an option before resorting to lethal force. The Burtons took their personal safety serious as illustrated by their habit of carrying two revolvers and three Bowie knives when traveling. Professor Kennedy has a mildly obsessive theme about people Burton did not know going into the desert for homosexual interludes that randomly pops up in the book. He includes a discussion of Burton and several earlier biographers who speculated about Burton's sexuality. But Kennedy failed to note those writers assumed Richard and Isabel had a loveless and sexless marriage, and they used outmoded, almost now quaint, modes of Freudian analysis. The illusion of the Burton's loveless marriage was gutted by the original sources brought to light by Ms. Lovell. Professor Kennedy fails to point out the deficiencies of Brodie and Mclynn concerning their analysis of Burton and sexuality. The deficiencies in The Highly Civilized Man about the question of Burton's sexual interests are too numerous to address in a short review nor are the issues he raised concerning Damascus, Crowley and others. Kennedy's treatment of Burton in Damascus is a travesty. Not once does the professor inform the reader that all segments of society in Damascus worked to bring Burton back from his recall. The Damascus treatment is lacking in necessary detail and skewered to the degree that the discussion should have been deleted form the book. It is also one of the examples where Kennedy included information that is extraneous to accomplishing his two professed themes. The book appears to have been written with segments produced using an academic analysis methodology with other portions written in an almost stream of consciousness with points lacking critical evaluation. Moreover, there are instances of contradiction. This leads one to conclude the work was not scrutinized properly before going to press. The Kasidah analysis includes a conclusion that Burton believed there is no God or afterlife, yet in the chapter titled the Afterlife, Kennedy indicates Burton may have concluded there is continuing life. In fact, towards the end of the Kasidah and towards the end of note 2, Burton makes it plain he has a positive view on a continuing future life. It is not a life however with the attributes of anyone's religious acculturation. The chapter on the afterlife in large part is one of the commendable aspects of this biography. All of the hallmarks of a work that will withstand the centuries are present in this work if only the good professor would later reissue it, and correct the many deficiencies and expand the themes of Burton as harbinger, Burton as catalyst, Burton as a pioneering mystic and Burton as scribe in the manner of Thoth, the Ancient Egyptian principle of wisdom.
0	4	I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read. The whole plot is just plain ridiculous. Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime. When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years. Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is? Avoid this one
1	1	This book is pretty lame compared to other texts on the market today. The YI Jin Jing description is terrible and of no use what so ever. Neither is the Shaolin 5 animals forms that are discribed in minute proportions. I don't care what the history of the manuscripts are, this book offers no definitive information. It is very vague and elementary, a lot like Smith's other books. The fighting methods shown are a poor representation of Shaolin skills. The true essence of Shaolin is beyond any manuscript, let alone a hoax manuscrpit from Taiwan, which is the inspiration for this book
4	4	'The Dog of the South' is a perfect novel. This sounds like hyperbole. It is short; there is very little in the way of plot; the characters do not develop in any way: yet the book is as engaging and entertaining as anything I have ever read. Before embarking on my second reading (just a fortnight after I finished my first) I planned to write down my favourite lines from the book. I gave up because I was transcribing almost the entire novel. No synopsis can do it justice. Ray Blount, Jr. has said of this book that 'no-one should die without reading it.' I'm with him all the way
0	1	I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much. It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder.
0	1	It is because of this book and the other books James Fetzer wrote with his dishonest pack, that people have lost so much interest in the JFK Assassination. Honest authors like Harold Weisberg and David Wrone attract less attention because they only published what they could prove and not what they dream up. The Z-film was altered, many know this, the Warren Commission published it in volume 18 (18H1-84) with frames missing. In case you don't know this, that counts as alteration. Z-film tampering was not to the extent that Fetzer claims such as painting Jackie's face on the film itself. The film was not stolen, or doctored up in anyway. No one would be dumb enough to take that risk
4	4	I just finished this book (for the second time, actually) and enjoyed it just as much as Reilly's other books. The hero of the story, William Race, is what many of us would like to be: a regular guy who, when thrust into extraordinary situations, very capably becomes the hero. Of course the action is over the top and unrealistic. It's supposed to be! I tell everybody who asks that Reilly is the best action writer I've ever read. I'm not sure why some people blast his books so bad. Do a little research and know what you're getting into. If you like high-powered, non-stop action, this is the guy for you. If you're not, then here's a clue: DON'T READ REILLY'S BOOKS!!! Sounds pretty simple
1	1	This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system. This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times. I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe. But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends. This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting. The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much. The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times. As a result, the book became a little boring. I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across. About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review. The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers. Secondly, I did not like the book. Plain and simple. That is OK. Not every book jives with everybody. I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring. I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus. You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you. I am free to express my opinions on these books. And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life. You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me. So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers. I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it. I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other
0	1	I am a black woman who happens to be dating a white man. However, when I first came across this book a few years ago, I was offended and frankly, shocked that something this blatantly racist and disrespectful could have been printed under the guise of a self-help book. Whoever the author may be, s/he must realise that the way to make a rational argument to the intended reading audience of black females is NOT to insult black men, who represent her brothers, her father or her friends. Another review on this board took the words right out of my mouth, when it stated that historically, it has been white-not black men-who have perpetuated the myth of the black [...], and who have been heavily invested in creating a sexually degraded image of the black woman in order to justify his sexual exploitation of her. Half of me believes [or wants to believe] that this book is actually a satire. I hope one day to have my hopes confirmed!
1	1	I do not quite understand why this should be a recommended Buk-Book. It is a fairly interesting interview, alright. But if you're going to spend money on Bukowski: buy HIS books. And if you want biographical information, go with Howard Sounes. To get a real good look on Bukowski you also might want to check out the 'Bukowski-Tapes' - Film-Interviews by Barbet Schroeder. Pivano's Interview reveals nothing new is not really worth the money
1	4	Sigh... Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts. Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line. This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing. So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score). The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features "Think of Me" and "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again" in their original form. For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about. So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out
4	4	Whether you've already used up the previous two Spanish guides in the Practice Makes Perfect Series (Spanish Verb Tenses, and Spanish Pronouns and Pronouns), or this is your introduction, this workbook is as good as it gets for the intermediate to advanced student of Spanish who wants to keep learning beyond the classroom. Complete Spanish Grammar has it all--friendly, down-to-earth language, exercises that could have been taken right out of Hispanic shops and streets and living rooms, and explanations of grammar components that actually make sense. I don't know how many times I've heard the exact phrases I just saw in the workbook while walking down the streets of Mexican towns. And since it's soft-cover, it's easy to take with you and work with while traveling. Hey, at $10.95, you can even afford to buy and extra one to keep in the car.
1	4	I read this book, aafter I had seen the movie several times and I must say, Elizabeth Levy left out alot of the Romance and other things. But she did put a different view on things. I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but I can't
1	1	OK, Mr. Koontz, Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence. This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment. Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again. Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs. What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz? Are you losing your mind? Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush. I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so. That seems to be around the time that you became a kook
4	4	Firstly, I must say that it is very difficult to summarize this book in any way. The complexity (and importance) of the material is such that there is no substitute for a direct, mindful read. However, if you are looking for a very worthwhile attempt at summarization, I suggest you read the review by ABC "bb" (I was persuaded to purchase by this review). Many reviewers have commented that "Choosing Reality" is an "easy read". While I do agree to an extent, it seems necessary to note that these comments are true only in relation to other books of the same nature. Considering the complexity of the subject matter, yes, this book is an easy read. In comparison to most literature, however, this "easy read" statement is perhaps less plausable. My point is this: do not expect this book to be simple (firstly, because it isn't; secondly, because it shouldn't be). This is of double importance if the reader is of a traditional, Western mindset. The content of "Choosing Reality" (especially the latter chapters) takes time to fully absorb. In fact, this book was, for me, the anti-thesis of a 'quick read'. That said, I must say that I enjoyed every long minute of it. Wallace does a wonderful job showing the flaws in scientific realism and instrumentalism, chronicaling the histories and the theories of each. He then thoroughly explains the comprimise, the middle way, the Buddhist way: a centrist view of reality. While the presentation of the centrist view was invaluable in its own right, the most enjoyable sections of the book came after this presentation. Wallace undertakes the very difficult task of using language to describe how the centrist view can be applied to our lives. Rather than just offering a theory, he describes how the centrist view deals with the mind, the nature of "physical reality", and the illusory "self". The author earnestly argues that the implications of the centrist view are real; implications that will certainly force you to re-evaluate the world you live in. The beauty of this book is that it caters to any audience. There is enough science to make it rational and reasonable; there is enough Buddhism to make it real and applicable. I consider this book of utmost importance to anyone interested in modern physics, Buddhism, the nature of reality, and/or the self. Finally, I must note that as much as this book is a religious view of science, it is equally (albeit more subtly) a scientific view of religion. As perhaps Wallace's greatest triumph in this book, modern science and religion are shown to be infinintely complimentary, both ultimately striving to understand the same things: the nature of reality and our role in it. To this end, "Choosing Reality" is a must read
4	4	This is the start to a story that will bring every emotion out of you. The characters, landscapes, different worlds, languages, fantasy, majic all tie in together and create a simply wonderful journey for a reader. To read this book and the entire story, please keep an open mind, let your imagination runn wild, and remember that this is a story that came out of a writer who struggled with this for 23 years yet he leaves enough for you to decided a lot of things for yourself. All the loose ends become tied together so keep reading. But above all read the books for the story not the ending, but I promise you'll be suprised and hopefully as I was, incredibly enlightened.
4	4	While this was not as good as its predecessor HLNO,it was great and provide follow ups on our main guys from HLNO. It was sexy and sweet, lots of teasing it will definelty leave you hot and bothered. There challenged in many ways which makes the end all the more speacial. I am really looking foward to the next story I feel it maybe even better than this one! Enjoy its worth the rea
1	1	Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with
1	1	Despite the praise heaped on this text, I can't help feeling that Bernard Faure has been constructing the 'straw men' other readers have spotted. It is by no means certain that the Ch'an (Zen) tradition has functioned as Faure suggests. Why, for instance, set up the 'anti-scriptural' argument - only to concede - on proper investigation, that it is a myth? There are enough commentaries - on the sutras, by Zen monks, to make this sort of thing seem pointless. Sorry, but lets place trust in those deluded masters of old - and stay unenlightened, Faure style.
1	1	The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again.
0	1	Huh? What happened to the ingested fig? To the excrement in the park? To the severed thumb buried in the floor? Yes these are major fuel sources that (up to a point) propel the plot forward. What happens, even in the broadest of terms, to the characters? To Wally for instance? Atmospheric yes and in some ways gripping but what a stinker of an ending. For Amazon to sell this book with (and by implication to compare it to) the exquisite "Shadow of the Wind" shows either a seriously impaired scheme for pairing books (set in 20th century Europe seems the only obvious similarity) or a desperate attempt to pawn off an overrun of lousy books on the coat tails of a great one
3	4	It really made me think. As a rule, I don't read religious books, but since this one was recommended to me, I ordered it. I wasn't sorry. It's an easy read, and I enjoyed it very much
4	4	A lyrical and beautifully written narrative of the struggle between the local railroad workers' union and their French overseers during a strike against the Dakar-Niger Railroad. Set in 1947 this novel describes a timeless environment which has gone unchanged in post-colonial West Africa. Given the hightened awareness of the plight of Africans today this novel gives a great insight into the history and background of their deprivation and poverty
3	4	McCammon delivers an excellent short story collection. You will get hooked on his writing style immediatly. There is plenty of gore and twists to even keep R.Laymon fans satisfied. The short story entitled : Blue World is somewhat of a spoiler in the row of brilliant horror storys of which Chico is the best
4	4	I liked this book alot, it was very different and it gave me alot of ideas of books to read based on what &quot;mood&quot; I am in. It also gave me some insite to some of the books that I have already read, and how they perceived the books
3	4	I bought this book with low expectation for both the poetry and the story. I'm happy to say that I was wrong. Emperor's Babe is sexy, stylish and just the most original book I've read in ages. The heroine is a tough little customer, a hip Afro Roman living in Londinium who meets the man of her dreams and loses everything else. By the time you come to last page I promise that you will be moved by her story
0	4	This was required reading for my 15 year old son and he said: It was boring
4	4	My aunt recently came to visit me and strongly suggested I read your "Don't eat the marshmallow...yet!" book along with the Motivational mini book. Since reading the book (just two days ago), one effect your book had on me was to set up a savings account that will transfer funds from my checking account twice a month. My aunt, along with your book, also inspired me use passages and quote some lines that I am using for my midterm paper. I wanted to thank you for the inspiration and additional motivation (that I YES needed!). I am continuing the domino effect and am recommending this book to my friends and even my boss. I will continue re-reading this book and adopt the marshmallow theory/delayed gratification as my own. I strongly believe this has provided a positive change in my life that I will repeatedly profit from
4	4	This book was supprisingly fresh. It had something new that other books just don't have. It was a very deep book. It realy does allow you to know existence bette
0	1	I was so disappointed by this book I could not get through more than a couple of chapters. The author may know about mountaineering, but he seems to know very little about Kenya. Moreover, I found the writing to be ethnocentric and quite boring
4	4	My 4 year old son and I stumbled across this book in the library and I immediately knew we had to have our own copy. The poem that constitutes the text of this book is simple and timeless. The illustrations are breathtaking. Each painting depicts the same train at the crossing, the various townspeople waiting at the crossing and the contents of the freight cars. My son loves inventing 'conversations' between the people waiting for the train to pass. A lovely book that is a nice addition to any child's library
0	4	I have Cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history, which was not passed down in our family, so I got this book to read in good faith. The author makes us sound like a bunch of backward, bloodthirsty, superstitious people, and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous (...). There is little in the book of the trail of tears, and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author, who believes he can mind read for people dead over 150 years. When he does get around to the actual trail of tears (the last sixth of the book) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were, and gets into how not that many people really died, and the Federal Government is being portrayed in a bad light historically. He also portrays the Cherokee Nation's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book, treating the Cherokee as a quaint, dead culture and people. It saddens me that college students are being given this to read. I learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book
0	4	What happened??? All we got was, "have you seen my cat?" "you are not my cat." "Have you seen my cat?" "You are not my cat." What's the point of this??? Seems like Eric Carle just wrote anything to make a buck. Stupid dumb book!!! Waste my money!!
0	3	Should be titled 'Art of Selling Products, Making Hundreds By Manipulating Prospects'. Excellent for brokers or insurance agents looking for a quick fix in getting appointments or products sales, but the buzz will wear off. A big disappointment for fee-based planners or advisors looking to expand their client base. It deals more with manipulating prospects over the phone than with practical face-to-face financial services sale
1	4	This is the favorite book of a friend of mine, she rereads it every year. She chose it for our bookclub, and the rest of us hated it! I think this is the best example I know of a book that either really connects with you, or doesn't at all. I have a degree in Eng. Lit. and certainly have encountered a number of books written in an unique or poetic style that I loved, but this one was for me rambling, full of tedious detail that lead nowhere and, since I didn't like a single character, I never felt invested in anything that happened to them. For others what was tedium for me, was poetry. I made myself read the whole book for the sake of the bookclub, but it was like taking medicine--still I can see that every word was a joy for my friend. This isn't a matter of being good or bad, its obviously a masterpiece for some, but if it isn't your kind of writing, you will find it more than a chore to get through
3	1	As a high school teacher I was surprised and pleasantly amused to hear that Jon Stewart had decided to make a Teacher's Edition of anything. When I found out that a colleague of mine had decided to buy the book and reference it in a History class I thought that I should look it over and see if it was worth its weight in satire. It is definitely worth its weight in something. I find that The Daily Show's viewpoint is refreshing and that Jon Stewart's attempts at unraveling the political veil is essential to what we consider Democracy. The Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction is a good reference and cocktail party conversation starter. I think that most of the book is interesting but I wouldn't want my child to come home and quote verbatim some of the blather that is inside. As a book for the masses sure. As a book intended for teachers no. I suppose that is the joke of it all. No teacher should use this text as a real reference or they would probably end up on 60 Minutes or The Daily Show explaining why their students were arrested for harrassing Supreme Court justices with naked pictures
4	1	A confession of an Economic Hit Man was excellent book on the United States government raises to global dominate via corporation American and private organization. The push for global dominate has been forced upon Americans through education, and media outlets.
0	4	May I first applaud Dr. Schneider in seeing the value of alternative treatments as opposed to traditional medicine. However Dr. Schneider as with most Md's is not a good source of information on alternative forms of treatment. Md's are lucky in their 1000+ hours of education to get one 1/2 of a class on nutrition and alternative therapies. Therefore their knowledge base is close to nil. Most of the stuff he lists is mainstream knowledge. His research is not complete and most of it requires you to talk to your MD first who in turn would very unlikely recommend anything natural. However, because Americans have a love affair with their Md's they spend 244 BILLION a year on drugs. This in turn has made Dr. Schneider's profession one of the top five leading causes of death in the nation (JAMA). Because of this Md's who are seeing a shift away from traditional medical care can capitalize immensely on this shift in care by billing themselves as experts. I'd recommend someone who has MANY years of experience in nutrition and alternative therapy. Nutritionists, Naturopathic Physicians, Ayruvedic Physicians, Doctors of Chiropractic and Osteopathic Physicians are much better sources of info. Think about it.
3	1	Although this book has been written almost 50 years ago it still provides basic insight into our behavior in the modern world. 'Money, prestige and power are the main incentives today for the largest section of our population - that which is employed'. This probably holds still today whereas some of the major concerns of the fifties are not concerning people any more. A book to read and think about
0	1	Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.' The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability. Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom. Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.
0	4	Page after page and line after line, this book is amazing in its power to frustrate even the most gawky-eyed initiate in the world of espionage-reading! Philby says pretty much nothing that will add to our knowledge of his ways and mechanics of operation. He is a fine writer, without doubt, but good writing befreft of content? He does not wax expansive on his faith - communism; he does not explain the hows of his first contact with the KGB; he does not even offer a strand of information on his life in Moscow, his marriage, his routine... aww, come on ... Pick it up and read it one three-hour layover at the airport... then place it in your library so that you have a book (for the record) that was written by THE spy who outdid 'em all!
0	4	Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over
0	1	President Ulysses Grant called the 1846 U.S. invasioin of Mexico, "the most unjust war ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." I see whatever piece of the "American Dream" that immigrants (legal or not) get from coming here as a sort of reparations for all the harm our military empire has caused other nations. Pat Buchanan has said, "if people don't want terrorism, we have to give up our empire." I think he's right, I'd just add that the same goes for immigration. To curb the influx of economic refugees, we have to reform NAFTA, end the exploitative behavior of transnationals (many US-based) in the maquilladoras, support Fair Trade, end the dirty work of places like the School of the Americas and figures like "Economic Hit Men," and so forth. Moreover, Wooldridge and others often speak as if the "Minute Men" are the only civic group working on the issue of immigration. Thankfully, there are groups like the American Friends Service Committee and Border Links that have a much more intelligent analysis of migration, and far more humane approaches to this complex issue. As General Smedley Butler said, "war is a racket," and that includes this war on immigrants. There is a lot of money that is being made from the building of a high-tech fence, aerial drones, motion sensors, videocameras, detention centers, and the other equipment of a police state. If we let that industry grow because of one scare or another . . . well, we won't recognize this country as the land of the free and the home of the brave. Rather than Wooldridge's fear and resentment-mongering, I'd recommend the upcoming boook by Free Speech Radio News host, Deepa Fernandes, which is titled, "Targeted: Homeland Security and the Business of Immigration." We could also learn a lot by listening to the leaders of Mexico's own movements for justice. There are many books and DVDs available regarding the courageous efforts of the Zapatistas. "I would rather die on my feet, than live a lifetime on my knees." -Emiliano Zapata
4	4	How is it that the Oakland A's have won the AL West in 2000, 2002, 2003 (and are all but assured of winning this year, 2006), as well as the wild card in 2001, even though they are in the bottom third of all major league baseball teams in total payroll? That is the narrative that Michael Lewis uses to tell the story of his book Moneyball. One of the central tenets of Moneyball is that there are objective statistics that although often ignored and undervalued, can, with some specificity, predict certain players' performances in certain areas. It is, however, only half the story, and as your rotisserie league friends will no doubt tell you, old news. The real story that Moneyball drives home is the challenge in getting people who actually make the decisions about the baseball teams to listen up. Lewis repeatedly describes how the Old Boys Club of major league owners (who Lewis affectionately refers to as The Women's Auxiliary), players, and journalists (former Cincinnati Red and current ESPN commentator Joe Morgan is appropriately skewered) reject this statistical approach that has sometimes been referred to as sabermetrics and the teachings of sabermetricians like Billy Beane (the book's main protagonist and current A's GM), Bill James, Dick Cramer, and others. And on the Old Boys Club the point is lost: that objective statistics have the potential to give small-market teams who cannot afford to compete financially with larger market teams for key players, the best chance of winning. When people point to the fact that the A's have not won the World Series since 1989 in spite their almost unparalleled success over the past eight years (roughly since 1999) is when Moneyball makes its point.
4	4	Along with Belinda and The History of Sir Charles Grandison, essential reading for all Jane Austen enthusiasts. In Camilla you will find Austen's inspiration for many different characters and situations. The 17 year old heroine of the novel is Burney's most enchanting. Her adventures are rich and surprising.The color of the 18th century infuses this book. Bring handkerchiefs, for there is pathos aplenty, but in a pure, non-cloying form. Eugenia, the stunted and unlovely but spiritually and intellectually exquisite sister of Camilla provides the soul of the book. This book contains suspense, glamour, romance, great wisdom and greater folly. Anyone who adores 18th C lit. will be sorry to turn the last page, though a thousand preceded it. In many ways this is Burney's happiest and most hopeful book. It was written as she was celebrating her liberation from spinsterhood into the estate of a married woman at age 40. We would be very lucky if anyone ever thought to turn this one into a film
0	1	I have read history books more interesting than this book. When i purchased the book i thought that it would be an interesting work. The book started off interesting. Then, as it progressed it got worse. Rent the movie. It would be much better. Trust me
1	1	Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did. I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable! It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness. Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty
4	4	I've seen several not-so-good reviews of this book so I wanted to write a good one. I'm not finished reading it yet, but I only have about 60 pages left and I've read enough of it to know that I'm thoroughly enjoying it. There are parts of the book that are laugh-out-loud funny and other parts that are so detailed and insightful that I am enjoying this novel on many levels. If you like authors whose writing is what I call "quirky" (a little on the weird side but I mean that in a good way...interesting and funny details on almost every page), you'll love this book. I know that my local library has at least three other books by this author and I intend to get every last one of them during my next trip to the library. The kind of quirky, comical, insightful writing that I like is best represented by the following book, which I actualy bought instead of borrowing it from the library, and I don't buy books very often: A Girl Named Zippy: Growing Up Small in Mooreland Indiana by Haven Kimmel http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0767915054/ref=pd_sxp_f/104-1969313-5510321?v=glance&s=books If you liked "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Elizabeth Berg, you will absolutely love "A Girl Named Zippy" by Haven Kimmel
4	4	Greene has clearly drawn out the ways of the seducer. Most of the men and women in here are naturals at seduction and are not consciously doing the principles taught. But those that tend to mess up their seductions can learn quite a few things from these people. With everything i teach at my site The Seduction Bible, i still believe that this book is excellent for those looking to score that one special girl. Those wanting to learn how to go out to a bar to pick up a woman are better off on sites like mine. But this book deserves 5 stars
0	1	I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all. When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!! ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books??? Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things. Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them. My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.
3	4	In England though she recently broke up with her boyfriend, seventeen-year-old Charlotte feels good about herself and her future as she is doing well in school, lives in a relatively happy all female home, and seems adjusted. That is until she learns she is pregnant. Her mom Karen is a teacher's aide struggling with her mother Nan's mind slowly slipping away with the demands from that side already overwhelming. Her patience is over the edge when Charlotte informs her she is pregnant. Upset and unable to contain her anger, Karen cannot believe that history has repeated itself because when she was sixteen she gave birth to Karen. Though she loves her daughter all her dreams died with her birth. She did marry the father but thankfully divorced that loser soon afterward. As Nan drifts deeper into the past including insisting that she adopted Karen, the mentally exhausted sandwich generation is not sure what to do as Charlotte decides to give birth except to flee in search of her biological mother dreaming of a loving comforting welcome. This fascinating character study is at its best when the audience sees deep inside the three generations with deep understanding of being an unwed mother, a child having a child, the sandwich generation, and the creeping of dementia (as well as a late stroke). When the tale spins off into the biological mother twist it loses some of its depth until Karen returns to her "real" family. Somewhat a soap opera, THE BAD MOTHER'S HANDBOOK is a strong family drama that focuses on the demands and responsibilities on women without men. Harriet Klausner
0	1	Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details
1	1	I'm sorry, but I expect more out of a book. Beginning on page one the character development was infantile and the writing sophomoric. After reading beautiful books such as Cold Mountain and Brideshead Revisited, to mention just two, I found that this book started off so poorly and was so amateurish that I knew it would be a plot-driven monstrosity that wouldn't be worth the read. At page four I was fed up with the author's style and slammed the book shut
1	4	Gives many examples of Weapons, most of which are useful. Gives no/few examples of Rings/Armours/Rods/Staffs/Shields Doesn't really think out a lot of the bonuses, also I question a lot of the penalties one has to take to use a Legacy weapon. About the only table worth taking is 4-1, or 4-2. Sure its a minus three to your saves, and a minus 2 to your attack power, and a whole SLEW of HP. The rest of them are so painful they aren't worth taking. Also all the caster "Tables" the ones your suppost to use if your a caster but losing caster levels and spell slots left and right doesn't make any sense. No matter what feats and wizardry skills its not worth it. Those could have been more thought out. Also I question the fact that in some cases the lowest tables, A, D, and G. Seem to be a lot better than the B, E and H tables just from the way they interact with things. I do fully agree that the top end capability you can add to your Legacy item is quite powerful, the I table is filled with many useful things the you wish you could have picked two of them. What I wish/want was if they're was some way to trade lower level slots to get you the capacity to get two I table skills. Also some way to get either more or less slots if you take a less dangerous or more dangerous tables of the legacy grid. The rules for weapons and fighters/barbarians/paladins/rangers. Are very well thought out and are very powerful. Yet for anyone other class they need heavy modification to be workable. In a Caster heavy campaign like the one I run and participate in its a very low value book
4	4	existence and perception in a phenomelogical sense; that is, physical health, emotional well-being, and spiritual contentedness are ways of describing aspects of one single, non-local reality. He advocates an approach to Western allopathic medicine which seriously examines the conditions of one's emotional and spiritual health. Why? Again, the state of one aspect of a person's reality influences, or perpaps even determines, the state(s) of the others. Dr. Dossey, in essence, is presenting an introduction to developing a healthy and homeostatic relationship within the world of an individual as well as the world in a very universal sense. A highly recommended read
4	4	The best book for college grads to read. Written by real people for real people. It's a MUST BUY!!
1	1	I thought this would be a list of adult grahic novels, like those of Harvey Pekar. A few were, but many were for children or comic book collectors. I do not think some of them really qualify as graphic novels. From the term "your library" I understood my own personal library, but seems it is for public librarians serving a mixed public. Fine, but I did not see that in the editorial description
4	4	this book is really good on many levels.theres really 2 stories going on.1 is how these 3 kids spent thier summer this one time,which is its more endearing side and the other story about this chick that got raped and how a racist town wants to pin it on this black dude.then theres this creepy boo radley guy and all in all its a great book.one of those you have to have read to call yourself educated about literature
4	4	Another in James D. Doss' Shaman series which began with The Shaman Sings in the mid 1990s. The series started off good and just keeps getting better. Doss marries a wry writing style with well-drawn characters, a clever story line and a fine understated humour. His setting is southern Colorado, a land of ranchers, wide spaces and capable country people both matukach (white) and Ute Native Americans. The Shaman of the series, wise old Ute Daisy Perika, doesn't feature to the extent that she has in other books in the series but her contribution via dreams and premonitions is subtle and true. Her character is the stuff the series is built on. She is abrasive and annoying, and takes pleasure in being so, yet the writer has made her irascible while likeable and she is the character the reader will remember long after the rest are forgotten. The story's central character is Charlie Moon, nephew of Daisy Perika and a Ute rancher and sometime policeman for his tribe. Charlie's major trouble in life is a mountain cat terrorising his ranch workers and cattle, until he is asked to find out who injured a U.S. Senator and at the same time killed Billy Smoke, the Senator's driver. The Senator, who runs the neighbouring ranch, has his own agenda and Charlie finds himself also involved in investigating a leak of damaging government information from the Senator's ranch. Charlie finds himself often on the tricky side of guns and dangerous animals (both human and not). It makes for a rollicking and thoroughly enjoyable read. No sex but some violence
4	4	"Don't Play In the Sun" by Marita Golden ***5 Stars This is a very disturbing subject, especially if you are lightskinned like me. Luckily, Marita Golden handles it with a lot of tenderness and care for others. I liked Marita Golden's book more than The Color Complex, because her life story gave it a specially intimate dimension. I would recommend this along with anything by Kola Boof, an Ethiopian author who has really been bringing this subject up in ways that literally stop the blood in your veins. Her novel "Flesh and the Devil" breaks this issue down but it's not for the squeamish. She's like Hardcore compared to Marita Golden and most authors I've read. I'm going to read "The Bluest Eye" next. "Don't Play In the Sun" is a NEW CLASSIC. People will be reading this for years.
1	1	Not quite the crapfest that was book 3 in the Ringworld series, but still a gigantic disappointment coming from Niven. Children is plagued by the same things that made the previous novel so unbearable: flat, uninteresting characters, ridiculous names, obsession over interspecies sex for no reason other than to include sex in the story, and overall a poorly written plot. To be fair, I didn't come out of this one as bewildered as after Ringworld Throne - don't even ask me to summarize THAT plot, I've yet to come across a decent one myself, mostly because trying to figure it out can cause lasting brain damage. But even so, this novel is nowhere near the original Ringworld novel, or even Engineers for that matter. Avoid if possible
4	4	These days, you don't see many people with the interest or guts to do what Jon Stewart and his co-workers do. In America, the book, they aim to teach misinformed Americans what their government is really about. Many people don't actually know what the heck goes on in the government, nor do they care. The book, filled with hilarious tidbits, great explanations, and well thought out presentations, aims to make the government interesting. It's got history, how the government works, modern day conflicts, theories, ideas, people, and what our Founders did for this great nation. It should be a book in every classroom and required reading for every citizen. Jon Stewart and the authors of this book went out on a limb for this. They went against the grain and did what they knew was right. It's our duty as Americans to criticize the government. When there's something wrong and you have the ability to fix it, you have the responsibility to fix it. Hopefully this has changed America
1	1	So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin. There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural, mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.
4	4	This is a fantastic book! Richard Feynman is a fascinating person and an excellent writer. His view of the world is exciting and interesting and his life experiences make for enjoyable stories. One lesson that comes through in this book is 'Think', don't be afraid to stop and think about something, a problem, a point of view, etc. Through these stories and the life of Richard Feynman, we are all shown what it is to live a life well. Get this book!
3	4	Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb, has created a successful series based on a few basic principles. The first, and in my opinion, most important aspect is a fascinating heroine, who presents different layers that the author has been revealing in each installment and will certainly continue to do so. Lieutenant Eve Dallas is a tough cop, who is relentless in her pursue of justice and feels as if the victims were hers to save. On the other hand, she is the wife of the billionaire Roarke, and has to deal with parties and charity events in which she is expected to mingle and maintain polite chit-chat with the guests. She has been adjusting slowly to this area of her life and even though she does not like it, she has learned to accept it. The fact that Eve was abused by her father when she was a child and had to kill him in order to escape also plays an important role in the development of the story and in almost every case Eve faces. Her husband also has a complex past, involving an abusing father who killed Roarke's mother and then lied to him about who his real mother was. Only recently did the billionaire learned the truth about this and reunited with what was left of his family. Besides the two main characters, Robb has created a supporting cast that adds appeal to the series and which I consider to be the second factor in its success. Peabody is Eve's former aide and current partner who has recently made detective and who usually adds a good part of humor to the narration with her witty comments. She is in love with McNabb, a policeman working in the Electronic Detectives Division, and they are in the process of moving together to a new apartment. There are other interesting characters: Feeney, Eve's trainer and mentor, Mavis, Eve's best friend, Nadine Furst, a reporter for Channel 75 who has become a close friend with Eve, Charles, a licensed companion who is now dating a doctor, and several others. One of the most appealing aspects of the series has to do with the development of the stories of each of these people, and that is why I recommend reading the series in order. The third and final element that helps create a superb series is the cleverly crafted world in which the action takes place: New York in the year 2059. The setting presents several characteristics that make it very different from our world, like cars that fly, drones that take care of household chores, the ban on firearms, the anticancer vaccine, the legalization of prostitution, the difficulty for getting real coffee, etc. Also, the advances in terms of technology require criminals to be more clever and careful when committing their crimes, and we usually end up reading about complex mysteries. In this novel, Eve is summoned to the scene of a ghastly murder. The victim was raped and strangled using a red ribbon and before leaving, the killer took out her eyes as a memento. The poor woman had a four-year-old kid and worked as hired help for a wealthy couple, and there is nothing that indicates that someone would have wanted to hurt her. Everything is business as normal until Celina Sanchez shows up wanting to talk to Eve and claiming she has information about the murder. Celina is a psychic and claims that she saw the killing in a vision. Even though Eve does not really believe in this stuff, she goes along with it following Peabody's advice and realizing that if it does not help at least it will not hurt either. This is not the first time Robb uses supernatural events in the series, but in her previous attempt she went too far making it hardly believable. In the present try the results were much better, and since the case Eve is facing is one of the best mysteries in the series so far, the overall quality of the novel benefits even more. As usual, Robb creates a good balance between the police procedural and the development of the personal stories of the characters in the series. Of course, the romantic scenes are still present through the narration, but without overdoing it. I was very pleased with this installment, and I am looking forward to the next one. A final word of advice, the publisher's blurb gives out important information regarding events towards the end of the novel. I would have preferred to read the book without knowing these facts. The good thing is that even if you read them, there will be a surprise waiting for you
4	4	For anyone interested in birds, birdwatching, or following your dreams this is a good read. For a teenager to have such a year as recounted here and be able to write in an entertaining way is truly a treat. Highly recommended
4	4	Penelope Fitzgerald is at her most devilishly entrancing in this tale revolving around the London acting school run (and I mean RUN!) by Freddie, a larger-than-life Gorgon whose will cannot be resisted. Fitzgerald has fun skewering the backstage pretentions, intrigue and petty jealousies of the London theater world of the early 1960s, but, clearly loving every seedy corner of it, she celebrates it with such gusto that you want to sign up on the spot for a season or two. That combination of wryness and fondness makes this short novel among Fitzgerald's most satisfying. And when Freddie goes out looking for a pound or two, hang on to your wallets
0	4	6 volume series? he man could have easily compressed this into 400 pages, but he's so long winded with everything. And reading this feels like i'm standing at the front door with Jehova's Witnesses. Ender's game was great. It deserves 5 stars. But i'm almost convinced it was written by someone else
3	4	The "Thief Lord" is a wonderful contemporary story full of loss, beauty, adventure and a little bit of magic. Cornelia Funke's book has one several literary prizes and even bumped Harry Potter off the best sellers list in Germany and Northern Europe for a time. It never talks down to kids and is engaging to adults as well. The imagery of Venice is dead-on (just like I remembered) and the characters(Prosepero, Scipio) are richly portrayed. This is a story that is light on the fantastic but heavy on imagery and imagination just like the classics! The main protaganists are boys but boys and girls can enjoy this book equally as there are a few standout female characters also. Geared to young readers 8-12 and also adults
4	4	Baseball fans with an affection for the sports history will relish the renewed examination of Babe Ruth's life and career, which packs in almost a hundred photos to supplement anecdotes from those who knew him. Readers will find here an affectionate examination of Babe Ruth's life and times along with a fine visual coverage of baseball history
1	1	This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading. I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book. But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end. That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel. This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form. This is unexcusable in my opinion. I just don't get it. I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages. I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book. This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever
4	1	This thick soft-backed "pocket" book has 490 pages. It could be called The Complete Whitman. It contains hundreds of poems. I am a senior citizen who had not read any Whitman for more than 50 years and am enjoying it very much. His descriptions of the 19th century's people, places, and inventions are eye-openers. He was actually a feminist before there was such a concept, and also an abolitionist. He truly believed in equality and democracy. He was a nature lover and wanted to protect the environment. Of course, there are parts I could quibble about, but that would be foolish. Whitman was a man ahead of his time.
4	4	Mr. Gilkerson has written something wonderful here; even 50 pages in and at the tender age of 40+ I was enjoying the ride. This is one fun book to read, and aside from some of the nautical terms used, seems very appropriate for an early adolescent. Also, as a hobby pirate historian, I can fully appreciate what the author has done in providing a background for the history of piracy in his narrative. He has provided this history in what I consider to be a very engaging manner; a manner that will drag the younger reader along entertainingly and educationally. Three hundred plus pages later, I was just as engaged as the author wound up his narrative. There are only a couple of minor things that could have been included to help the young reader: 1) a glossary of terms, 2) a labeled image of ship rigging, and 3) a collected bibliography for further reading. In the end, those are fairly minor points when considered in the context of the overall entertainment value of the book. My hearty thanks to William Gilkerson for entertaining me with this splendid tale. P-
4	4	As I am a scholar and an expert of Na-Dene groupings, I find this to be one of the most fascinating and remarkable volumes of THE HANDBOOKD OF NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS. The photos and linguistic data are absolutely fascinating and the authentic information -that so captivates every micro-molecule of my attention- is astonishingly elating! I have recently been able to determine -thanks to the many rare and authentic photos of this book- that many of the Northern 'Athapaskan' tribes are not totally 'mongoloid', as I had previoiusly surmised. I have discovered Indian (from 'India') and Turkish strains that are especially, concentrated in northeastern British Columbia and northwestern-Northwest Territory bands. These findings have shed much light on my Na-Dene origin theories, regarding the genetic makeup of the Na-Dene forbears. AWESOME!!
3	1	Fareed Zakaria rightly forces his readers to think harder than they usually do about the interdependence existing between freedom and democracy. In the West, constitutional liberalism, with its checks and balances, gave birth to modern democracy. However, too much democracy can paradoxically lead to less freedom. Think for instance about humiliated Germany after WWI under the Weimar Republic and its subsequent mistreatment of different minorities for specious reasons under the Nazis. Similarly, more choices can result into less accountability. Think for instance about those who fail to plan financially for old age independent of a social security system increasingly at risk of insolvency due to shifting demographics. In the U.S. and overseas, right without responsibility is usually as immoral and unjust as responsibility without right. Unelected bodies such as the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Federal Reserve, or the World Trade Organization are a necessary evil. Expertise of their respective members is judged more important than their democratic legitimacy to hopefully pursue the better good of either a human community or a society of sovereign states. These unelected officials are not held accountable to the tyranny of instant gratification that too many elected officials perceive, rightly or wrongly, among a majority of their constituents. Because unelected bodies are a necessary evil to account for human weaknesses, they should remain the exception rather than the rule. Pleading for an increase in unelected bodies, though well-intentioned, could paradoxically lead to a weakening support of the best-in-class in their respective categories.
0	1	This is basically a book of few words, many uninspiring photographs, and a some weak hints here and there that reveal to you the astonishing secret of clutter-free living: just buy a bunch of cute and clever containers to store all your junk! There is virtually nothing meaty in this thing about how to get organized and STAY clutter-free.
3	4	This is one of the best books on fencing writen by an American. It's major weakness is that it often attempts to teach both foil and epee and the same time . The author does address modern fencing , a subject often ingored. This book is good for the person that knows how to fence and wants some pointers; not a good read for beginners . A good book but kept me wanting more, for example the author tells nothing of how she took up the sport and what it's done for her. Close only 4 of 5 stars
0	3	This book is written more like a textbook and unless you have a degree in Criminal Justice or something of that nature, it reads like stereo instructions! Not impressed at all
4	4	This is a fascinating book about one of the best (relatively)young directors working. As usual, Mr. Parish has done his homework. The background material is great and helps give a really vivid picture of the person. I really feel I got to know Mr. Van Sandt from reading this book, not only him, but his family and associates growing up. The descriptions of his early works are especially interesting. Mr. Parish is one of the most thorough writers when it comes to work credits of his subjects. I also enjoy this section of his books. I definitely recommend this book
1	1	This book does start with some slight promise. It has a touching opening chapter. And it follows the life story of one of its villains, who is a very unlikely, over-the-top character, but who nevertheless will probably win your sympathy and may even break your heart. The book also has plenty of Cornwell's trademark technical detail. You will be treated to a wide variety of how-to tips on everything from how to fly a helicopter, to what gun to carry for different law enforcement jobs, to how to identify watermarks on paper. But overall, I found this book to be a big disappointment. First of all, the book is riddled with egomania. Almost every chapter contains some lavish adulation of the protagonist, Kate Scarpetta. Almost every character oozes adoration of Scarpetta, lives only to win her respect, longs for her, even in planning to kill her seeks only to unite with her in ecstasy. What's all this about? Since Scarpetta is so clearly Cornwell's alterego, a reader can only conclude that Cornwell herself is getting lost in a cult of personality. However, Scarpetta doesn't appear much in person in this book. She remains a presence, inspiring others. When she does make a personal appearance though, the book's tone of adoration doesn't mute into any more seemly modesty, as would seem appropriate when an author is in essence describing herself. If anything, the deification of Scarpetta intensifies in these scenes. For example, a man observing her, notes how deliberately she does everything. Even in the act of reaching for her coffee cup, he sees her "exuding confidence and power." Really, all this reverence for Scarpetta turns these pages into absurdity. Even apart from their hero worship of Scarpetta though, many of the other characters in the book are manifestly improbable, or even impossible. A book could perhaps stand one over-the-top villain, such as the bizarrely afflicted one I mentioned in the first paragraph of this review. However, most of the characters in Blowfly, evildoers and presumed good guys alike, are leading lives of such mythic proportions, that the book loses all touch with reality. Scarpetta's niece, who has been an on-going character in Cornwell's books, turns into a full-blown cartoon superheroine here, with preternatural command and capabilities across international borders. One of the actions this niece involves herself with in this book is so outrageous and of such questionable morality, that this subplot would seem more appropriate as back-story for a Nintendo game. There are also specific stylistic problems with the book. Cornwell has often used the technique of short chapters, snapshots of sorts, interlacing the actions of the different characters. The technique can be a valid one, building suspense while you are briefly diverted from one character's pending homicide, to the less crucial actions of some subsidiary player. And the technique can be used like a mosaic, to build a picture tile-by-tile. But with Blowfly, the chapters have become so short that it seems a mere pandering to readers' presumed short attention spans. I'll admit the TV ad pace of the book kept me going through to the end. Snap. Snap. Snap. Now this. Now the other. But I'm not proud of my growing addiction to this kind of hit-and-run narration. Then there's the persistent, occasionally jarring use of the present tense - in a context in which this couldn't all possibly be happening in real time. And there are too many ongoing, hackneyed analogies between the brain and various machines. Cornwell has always liked these comparisons, but they become constant pebbles in the shoe here. "No frontal lobe alarm sounds" rang... "...her brain can't process"... "jerking her mind out of gear"... Finally, there is the problem with the book's ending. It's as if Cornwell ran out of paper, or else was ordered by her publisher to simply turn in her manuscript, finished or not. All her knowledge of CSI investigative technique count for nothing in the end. None of the plot threads get really integrated into coherence. So there are a few good things about Blowfly. You get to inhabit another serial killer's mind and daily squalid living conditions with creepy intimacy. There are also some interesting psychological insights into the motives of female accomplices or "enablers" of such men. There are things to be learned about defense weapons. But these good things get swamped, like the dead bodies that fall into the bayous of Baton Rouge where much of this book's action takes place. Overall, I'd say if you see this Blowfly coming your way - get out the flyswatter!
0	1	James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust.
4	1	Great! It was about time that the biggest monster of them all was exposed. "Biggest", not simply because of the unprecedented number of deaths that he caused, but because he was so utterly trivial. As Jung Chang/Halliday show, he wasn't ideologically inspired, he had no liking for his own country and its tremendous culture, and he couldn't sustain mature relationships with other human beings. His motivation was apparently selfish, spiteful and capricious, like the school bully who finds himself running the school. He let the Chinese people starve, while pumping resources abroad to pay for military technology or win the approval of Third World tyrants and "liberation movements". Again, great! Because this book may remind us in the West just how foolish many of our bright young people were back then. On the political demos of the Sixties, the Maoists stood out for their brutality and brainlessness, and total lack of any sense of humour. Many of the intellectuals of the time seem to have been either fooled by Maoism, or bought. They did dirt on the values of their own culture while (figuratively or literally) waving the Little Red Book. Most of them have moved on, but this book might just remind them of creepy behaviour that they'd prefer to forget. Finally, two criticisms that have been made of Jung Chang/Halliday by some reviewers. Firstly, the lack of balance. Well, was there anything remotely attractive about Mao or the things that he did? He "reunited China" - yes, but that doesn't mean that without him it would never have happened, in fact some of the political opponents that Mao destroyed along the way might, given the chance, have presided over a far less monstrous regime. Secondly, the journalistic style of the book. True, occasionally it lapses into cliche, but the text remains accessible and easily readable for anyone who wants to know more about Mao. Compare this with Mao's own turgid platitudes, or the incomprehensible screeds of Marxist intellectuals. Let Mao have the last word. In 1940 he wrote the following, and one might stop to consider how he lived up to this commitment to the Chinese people, and at what cost to them: "It is not hard for one to do a bit of good. What is hard is to do good all one's life and never do anything bad, to act consistently in the interests of the broad masses, the young people and the revolution, and to engage in arduous struggle for decades on end. That is the hardest thing of all!"
1	1	I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead
0	1	The book is worthless. It was extremely high level and should have been titled &quot;configuring windows 2000 server security for dummies&quot;. This book is not for anyone with Security or W2K experience....move one and don't waste your time or money
0	1	No intellectual can afford to be unacquainted with the immortal John Dewey and his "experimental school." Who would dare criticize the education legend inseparably linked with the irreproachable rhetoric of "progressivism?" I would. Dewey's conception of the child as learner assumes that the uneducated mind is essentially capable of directing its own knowledge by a spontaneous inquisitiveness stemming from nature study. This he then expects to blossom into a more expanded consideration of the various academic subjects with the teacher merely facilitating transitions and answering the child's self-posed questions. The problems in Dewey's model begin with his science fair-meets-museum-meets-playground-meets-lecture hall school design: the model is untested on any large scale and the cost plus upkeep is prohibitively expensive. Classes are small and require several specialists and non-reusable materials. As if kids didn't have enough problems with the basic skills set already, Dewey would have them heavily involved in shop and home economics. Even more outrageous in Dewey's model is the premise that we ought never force students to study what they do not like. Their own intellectual prejudices reign supreme and by implication, teachers are discouraged from evaluating against solid standards. Experienced teachers know that kids can easily hide their shortcomings even when required to study their weak subjects, and that remediation is hard to implement before they slip further behind. How could Dewey's recommendation to cater almost exclusively to the child's intrinsic likes NOT further disguise and exacerbate low performance? Deweyism of course, like many other off-the-wall theories of education, denies Behaviorism when it refuses to acknowledge psychological patterns in man. It depicts formulaic teaching and learning as fundamentally faulty and generalized curricula as harmful to student individuality. Nothing could less representative of the quality research conducted, particularly Project Follow Through: the great skeleton in the student-centered advocates' closet. I'd personally like to see Dewey's updated plan for seamlessly moving kids, who come into class with their "natural inquisitiveness" programmed by TV, rap music, and other pop media, into colonial American history, calculations of hyperbolic asymptotes, Tennessee Williams, and the "plus-que-parfait" tense. But of course, such leaps of interest are unnecessary if we utterly throw out the old-fashioned academic corpus along with the old-fashioned school system. 90% of students in high schools today report that they do NOT feel adequately challenged. Maybe the answer doesn't lie in yielding to children's lack of intellectual discipline but in tapping their potential to control that uninformed caprice. Dewey's "progressivism" relies upon the contradiction of allowing uneducated mind educate the teacher on its own education. From the absurdity of it, I can only conclude that sane people latch onto this school gedankenexperiment to maintain an escapist fantasy in light of dismally high drop-out rates, lowered standards, and social discord. But a radical solution is not necessarily synonymous with a good one
0	1	The manual helped my husband in writing his reports in the APA format. The only thing he recommends is that there should be more examples in the book. At times, he has to search for the items that were not clear in the internet
1	4	If you've read her Amanda Quick novels, this contemporary story is almost the exact replica of the novel, "Scandal". Heroine proposes to hero, who has a hidden agenda. Of course he's rich and he has almost the same history as "Scandal", whose father has gotten into debt and gets out of the picture leaving the family to deal w/ the debt, and the oldest child having to pay back debts that his father's friends/business associates want paid right away. Of course hero grows up and wants vengence for this when he grows up. But his plans get waylaid when heroine interferes and convinces hero that vengence is not the right path. The book is so similar that a couple of times I caught myself looking at the cover to make sure I had the right book. The only difference in this book is that one is set in contemporary times and the other in historical time
1	1	The relationships between the various characters weren't convincing and I failed to connect to the main character, Lottie, at all. The book seemed to ramble on, and didn't catch my interest. There were a few parts where the action picks up, but they were like tiny islands surrounded by a vast ocean of blandness
0	1	I bought the Panther edition of this book, and found it contained a great deal of useful information. However, I felt it did not serve well for a reference material for two reasons... 1. This book is huge. It needs to be perfect bound or made into two separate volumes. 2. Though the index is quite extensive, there is no way to adequately search the book for troubleshooting Mac OSX. Both points would be obviated by the inclusion of a CD containing an ebook, preferably as a PDF. I reported this to the publisher, but apparently they disagree since this version does not include a disc. For this reason, I have decided not to purchase this book until future editions include this. I'm writing this here in hopes that the publisher will read this, and act accordingly
1	1	I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on. I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life
0	4	this book absolutly stunk like a skunk. it had no plot and was very boring. Just kidding this book was amazing filled with fun laughter and lessons. I couldn't put it down. not
0	1	Would the woman writing under Joyce Carol Oates' name these days please return America's greatest living author to us? Seriously, this was the most unenjoyable, in fact most distressingly bad, book by Oates I've read, among the maybe thirty I have had the utmost pleasure to read. I don't know what vein Oates is tapping to construct these writings but the prose does not sound like her at all, the stories themselves are unimpressive, unwelcoming, unpleasantly centered on people who do not merit consideration. And worse still, I find this is a trend with Oates these days. I can't think of a single book she's published since Middle Age that has been (yes, strictly in my opinion) any good. The short story in Female of the Species that was called "Madison at Guignol" was perhaps the worst Oates story ever published. (And yes I do understand the connotation of the word "Guignol" in the title.) Some might accuse me of approaching Oates with preconceived notions and then recoiling when she fails to deliver what I, myself, wanted, but that's not the case. One thing I have always applauded in this author is her chameleon-like ability to cross genre boundaries and create tales so divergent in theme and tone that they could have been the opus of a half-dozen different people. I have avidly read along thru Gothic stories, mysteries, romances, non-genre pieces, novellas, poems, short fiction, novels, literary criticism and plays by Oates, and so I believe I can fairly say I do not stereotype Joyce Carol Oates or expect any one thing from her, but in this case, as much as reporting it pains me, this was a bad book and I can only hope Oates bucks the trend and reaches back into the well of talent the world knows she has, and that her next book(s) will be much better
0	1	I wasted time reading this book that I will never get back. It was repetitive, predictable, and drawn out. I only finished the book hoping for a twist in the ending, but it turned out the way I thought it would. Buy this book if you want to feel good about yourself for finishing it quickly, and for predicting how the story goes. But, I would not waste the time if I were you
1	1	Pros: Someone recommended this book to me, and when he did, I asked him why in the world would he think I'd be interested in a book written by a cop, specifically because I've never made it a secret that I do NOT trust police and I'm extremely burnt out on the Biggie/Tupac's death considering I wasn't a fan of either of them. He told me that it talked about some interesting parts of hip hop crime and that there was only one chapter on Biggie and Tupac. Indeed, he was right. This book delved into the Jam Master Jay killing, along with the criminal issues of Murder Inc., Young Jeezy, Jay-Z, Diddy, 50 Cent, J. Lo, Lil' Kim, Foxxy Brown, Suge Knight, Snoop, Game, Dr. Dre, etc., in addition to the murders of Freaky Tah, Tupac, Biggie, and more. It was interesting to read about the details that I did not hear in these cases, such as cops handcuffing J. Lo to the top of the cage. That's a prime example of why I feel the way I feel about cops. Was it really necessary to do that? In that aspect, I can feel this book. There were many times when Parker complained about how the NYPD handled witnesses and innocent victims as though they were criminals, and he hit it right on the head by explaining that if the NYPD continues to be as domineering and violent as they have been to get people to talk, the streets and crime will continue to be on different playing fields with no intentions of a fair game. Cons: 1) I'll admit that even as a professional copyeditor, I can look over errors. It's much safer to let at least two pairs of eyes read a manuscript than one. I'm hoping that's what happened with this book. No copyeditor will catch every single error, but about a quarter through this book, I was seeing so many errors to the point where I wondered was it copyedited at all? Commas out of place, words in the wrong order, past tense with present tense, and other glaring errors that should've been caught by even the most casual reader. 2) I was so tired of this man patting himself on the back. It was to the point where I thought he was molesting himself trying to talk about how great he was. He kept italicizing "I" and "me" as if we didn't understand that he deserved credit for something. Then, he kept on bragging about how cops were coming to him for help because he knew about hip hop. In mid-story, he'd start talking about how he knew something was wrong because he was so well-informed of the subject. Okay, we get it. If the man had just told the story and his actions, we could've come to the same conclusion without reading about you and your Hip-Hop Superman Cape. 3) Over and over again, he made idiotic statements that only cops can come to the conclusion of. The word "accidentally" and "Amadou Diallo" should NEVER be used in the same sentence. That was flat-out intended murder; nothing accidental about it. Even though he kept saying that hip-hop was not the full reason for violence, he kept throwing out all these random examples about how they equate, without ever mentioning the fact that poverty can play a great big hand in that. He uses examples like Kanye West to say that some rappers don't go down the same violent path, but what a drastic comparison. Kanye West didn't live nearly the life that Snoop Doggy Dogg did and there's no way anybody is going to tell me that the neighborhood and economic gain does not play a hand in the attitudes that many "gangsters" and drug dealers have in how they view life. This is not to say that it is right for them to be suicidal all the time, but I can't see how he couldn't understand that. 4) Throughout this whole book, he made it seem like he was one of the best cops and he seldomly talks about anything he does wrong. Even when he does, he blames it on his boss making him do it (ex. creating the hip-hop binder). He claims he's not a drinker but consistently talks about how he doesn't remember certain places he was at because he was so drunk and having fun. He talks about how other cops were scared but he was excited to be in drug-ridden, violent areas of Brooklyn. That in itself concerns me. To me, that's like saying that this cop viewed these areas like the board game Clue. He may find it amusing that he caught the killer, but none of these killers, witnesses, and children in the area find their everyday life "fun." It's very easy to criticize one's lifestyle when you don't have to live it on an everyday basis. 5) The man seems to have all of these answers about how the NYPD and LAPD should operate to be a more productive police force, but there was something he did in this book that only stamped the "Why I Hate Cops" attitude into just about everyone who mildly thought it before. There's a huge no-snitch policy in poverty-stricken areas (and quite a few middle-income areas too, the more the police act a fool)! Every single time he talked about issues within criminal cases, he gave out real names of witnesses, as well as ALL the information they gave. He talked about buying them food and how so many were cooperative in telling their stories. But the information he gave may not have all been accessible to the public. Some of the killers got off free, and I don't even understand why he put so much information about what the victims said in this book. Does he think all criminals don't read? All they need is ONE friend to say that their name was mentioned in the book, and there's a whole new set of problems for these witnesses. Victims and witnesses risk their lives telling stories about what has happened around them, and a cop documenting all the details in the book does not make anybody feel safer to go running to the cops. If anything, it makes them more hesitant. Just about every chapter, I was shaking my head and thinking "He can't help it. He's a cop. He doesn't understand how goofy it is to document this type of information." Even if it's someone who hasn't been in a situation where they have to be a witness, a cop repeatedly bothering you can work a person's nerves to the point where they don't want to help you simply because they don't like YOU. I went to a high school a block away from a police station and was harrassed ALL the time for unexplainable reasons, even as a reasonably innocent teenage girl. It's going to take more than the no-snitch rule to get people to help in these communities. Cops have to pretty much change their WHOLE attitude before a lot of these people will trust them. 6) He speculates on how hip-hop is becoming organized crime and how Jay-Z and 50 Cent have marketing deals. I don't even understand this comparison. It's not like these were dudes fresh off the street who walked in rapping and got gymshoes. They both had to fight their way to the top for these companies to even pay attention to them. Yes, they were both drug dealers IN THE PAST. So what? Is every marketing company supposed to look at their background, ignore the fact that they are legit now, and not do business with them? If that's the case, America wouldn't have survived this long. This country was created from thieves and slaveowners. If Wall Street can get rich, so can hip-hop. Parker talks about how most Fortune 500 companies wouldn't do business with people with this background. I hate to break it to this dude, but if companies weren't going to get rich off of criminals, America wouldn't be one of the most powerful countries that it is now off of FREE labor and the attitude "well, it's all in the past now." As I figured, I didn't like this book and it didn't improve my opinion on cops, but when he wasn't talking about how great he was, I did find out some missing information that the media has screwed up in their daily reports
0	1	I very much looked forward to the ending of this book not to see what would happen but so that I could be done with it and move on to a different book! I found this book pointless. After reading 482 pages, I can't even think of two adjectives to describe Sally and Clare. Moody does such a poor job of character development that I don't feel like I know all that much about these two women. I did not like the main characters and I didn't feel as though they had much of a real friendship at all. The book is way too long, the plot is unbelievable, the characters are unlikable, and the writing style is annoying
4	4	This book has something for every event in a garden. Planting, designing, what to grow and how to grow it. It is one of the most useful gardening books that I have on my shelf and use it often. In the winter its great to read and work out any previous season problems and plan for the new year
4	1	"The Andromeda Strain" may be an antique in science fiction, having been published in 1969, but that hardly diminishes its excellence. The caliber of Michael Crichton's research is such that I still found the technology and science in the book impressive (though the computers were obviously dated) despite the book's age. The plotline is thrilling, and though some of the scientific and philosophic asides are lengthy, most are equally fascinating. I was slightly disappointed by the ending; however, the rest of the book was amazing and made the reading worth it
0	1	Perhaps Malkin would know better than to write a completely idiotic book that disgracefully bashes liberals while doing nothing to prove that conservatives are any better because they aren't. All fault finding and no solutions. If Malkin really was a conservative, she wouldn't have shown her intolerance to others. THE DEATH OF CONSERVATISM The Destruction By The Neo-Cons Of All That Was Held Dear By Conservatives Has A Growing Number Joining The Ranks Of Independents by Samuel A Stanson [...
0	3	After finishing The Thread That Runs So True by Jesse Stuart, I sit here to give you my review on this book. Even though the book didn't catch my attention that much it had its ups and downs. The only thing that caught my attention while reading this book was how he fought back against the "man" and got his job back, but then he stuck it to them at the end. As for the down points of the book it would have to be the rest of the book. I could not in a million years honestly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a book to read
3	4	The book The First Part Last by Angela Johnson is a story about a teenage boy and his life as a father. In his sixeenth birhtday his girlfriend gives him some new that changes his life forever. The story flips back and forth from present time to the past so you can predict at times why certain things are the way they are. his story seems very realistic compard to what many teenage fathers go through. In the story he finds it hard to balance his school work and taking care of the baby, especially since his parents do not heop much. Finally he ends up breaking down and gets in trouble for it as well. This book shows the struggles of teen pregnancy and what many teen fathers and mothers go through. If you enjoy this book you would probably enjoy the book Hanging on To Max as well
0	1	I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy. But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer. I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity? Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk? That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic. Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon. If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch
4	4	My 19 month old loves this book. She is a huge Elmo fan and loves it when he says, "Elmo loves you." Any young Elmo fan will enjoy the book, although the reader will probably grow weary of it quickly
4	1	The book arrived in good condition, and is indeed a hip-pocket sized book
1	1	I don't understand why this book has the ratings of the other reviews here. It is a big disappointment. While this book has some interesting tips between the lines (that's why I give it 2 stars instead of one), it is merely a rambling of a self-important producer. The 303 "solutions" are at best 303 anecdotal stories. Take solution #96 "How to Shoot in a Boat" for example, it reads, in its entirety "I always seem to get the jobs of shooting from some kind of moving vehicle. You've read my exploits in the air and on the ground, but what about in the water? Shooting footage from a boat is a skill that someday I will master. Not wanting to delve into jet skis, Ski-Dos, or speedboats, I will be discussing motorboats and sailboats." Great solution Chuck! That really makes my filming much better. Perhaps it would be possible to cut down this book into 99 tips and solutions, but in the style its been written it would still be painful to read and extract useful information. Furthermore, the cover says, "solve any video or edit problem in 10 minutes or less". Not only is that untrue but also shows how silly this book is. The picture of a consumer DV camera also has nothing to do with the content, because Chuck uses big professional equipment throughout this book, stuff that takes more than 10 minutes to just unpack by the way. I haven't found a good book to suggest as an alternative yet, but don't waste your money on this one. Try any other
1	4	I've read and often re-read most every PJ book and column ever written. I've always liked this guy. I keep his books after I've read them instead of taking them to the local used book store. "On the Wealth of Nations" did not work. Honestly, it sort of skidded into a ditch and got stuck from page one. It reads like the meeting minutes of a local book club. It's not so much PJ, it's the concept of taking possibly one of the country's biggest early day doorstops of a read and then having a top-end writer in the 21st century translate it with some political satire and humor for spin and flavor.. It just doesn't land. What may compound it all is that PJ's writing doesn't have quite the sharp edges on it as it used to. Age brings that on in all of us. PJ hasnt quite hit the grumpy ol' man part of his career yet. To take a book like the Wealth of Nations and do a think-tank review on it is asking a lot of any author with any style or talent. PJ gave it a go but honestly, I yawned a lot
4	4	The book delivers what it promises: a modern look on the abramelin operation and the possible procedures involved in obtaining the so called knowledge and conversation with your Holy Guardian Angel, samadhi, or whatever your label of choice is for this ineffable experience you are after. Just like "The New Hermetics" (another title by the same author which I sincerely recommend for those with an interest in magick and/or NLP...and how big is the difference between the two after all?), 21st Century Mage keeps an eye on the past and tradition, while at the same time cutting through whatever may be superfluous, and keeping a very effective, non-dogmatic, outcome-oriented attitude. If you have a general interest for the abramelin operation and are after a good read, or if you are looking for the book that finally makes it sound feasible, explains how, and spurs you to seriously invest your time to DO IT, 21st Centruy Mage definitely has its place on your bookshelf
1	1	I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK
4	4	The perfrect book for a person jonesing for the complete culutral history of the jock. Well researched and well structured, the book is a comprehisive guide to everything penis. Don't let whimsical chapter titles like "The Demon Rod," "The Gear Shift," and "The Puncture-proof Balloon" fool you; this is a work of great socio-political importance. As man has evolved, so has his relationship with his organ, and to understand him, you must understand his member. David M. Friedman has given you the map towards total penile nirvana
0	4	The first line in the book talks about rain as a torrential torrent. It gets worse. But who am I to say? I quit on page 39, shortly after the black belt 72 year aunt old scares the traumatized dog into the bath by putting on a ninja mask and jumping into the kitchen screeching, "Eyowwww." Beyond awful
3	4	... the basic plot's the work of a genius. Roland and his Tet are carriors of the task to save a "Calla" village from an attack of so - called wolves. The task is fulfilled perfectly, so the newly grown Tet's about to move on which they'd love to do - BUT... As I said above, the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically, if the author would only have kept it a LITTLE shorter. E.G. the new Tet member's self - told biography shows some details which don't really wanna fit into the actual Tower story at all; all they show is how the guy came into this world, still Midworld, of course. Most of the rest, however, is told fantastically, as I said above. When Eddie comes to talk to Calvin Tower about the house ground with the Rose on it ("Waste Lands" readers will know what I mean) or Susannah's mind is caught by another person, differently said: Detta and Odetta receive company, those facts are told GREAT!!
3	4	This book compiles about 23 issues of spidey's earlier adventures, going through many important chapters. It doesn't seem to give quite as much satisfaction as the first three volumes, perhaps because most Spidey fans have seen reprints of some of the issues contained in this volume. If you're new to spidey, snag this... if you're not new, still get it to fill in your blanks =)
0	1	I am disappointed and I haven't even read it yet. If anything Steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind. Please read his review and decide for yourself. I still plan to buy the book but as with everything else I will take it with a huge chunk of salt. Sounds to me like the so called "Conservatives" have just put out another book to "unbiasedly" support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses. There is no such thing as a conservative any more. If you want to get back to constitutional government, go check out the Libertarian party and view their positions. They come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people, by the people and for the people. The rest of them are still just self serving and don't want to let go of their power and your money. Dan
4	1	I realize that reviews are wholly based on interpretation and opinion and I respect that. But I don't get people who don't like this book. No offense. That being said (or written, in this case), I loved this book. I found it entertaining, odd and hugely funny and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh. My grandmother wouldn't get this humor, so if you're her, don't buy it. Everyone else--go for it.
4	4	Be prepared to weep at the end but this novel is beautiful. Writing is superb and the characters are not only believable but they stay with you long after you close the book. Anjali is waiting for her husband, Prakash, to pick her up after a trip to her parents. Prakash doesn't show and Anjali faces a life-changing situation as a result. Anjali divorces, remarries and has a son, Amar. The story weaves their fragile lives with a past that comes into the present. Chapters are short and moving; each brought across by the character's feelings and thoughts. Can't say enough good about this story. Remember your kleenex and get ready for a novel to stay with you
4	4	The subtitle of the book, "The Friendship That Won The Civil War" would imply that there really was a friendship, and indeed it seems the relationship between Grant and Sherman was destined to create a winning duo. That makes it unique, not just because of the resultant Union victory, but it really does stand out as the one relationship among the senior leadership of both sides that was capable of creating the kind of synergism necessary to win the struggle. The only other comparable relationship was Lee and Jackson, which was every bit as successful, but didn't survive the war. There are too many anectdotes in the book to mention, but I can say that I learned a lot more than I had previously gleened from separate biographies. Grant was clearly a victim of disappointing performances by subordinates, Sherman being a glowing exception. And Sherman's armies needed the type of visionary leadership that ultimately unleashed them to win. Yet the contingent nature of the events leading to the monumental victories are pointed out again and again. Such were the nature of promotions and military politics in the day. A fast paced read. The relatively quick descriptions of the battles are much appreciated. If Grant and Sherman seemed like inspiring characters before, Hood's book will convince you that the story of their friendship not only won the war, but had a profound impact on 19th century America well beyond 1865
1	1	The numerous vague flow charts, weak graphics, and conflicting statements did little to promote the learning process. Cites many dated studies and implies causation with little statistical relevance. Similarly, the author's exam questions led to more frustration as many appear to be developed to trick the reader
4	4	This is the sequel to LIQUOR, the first of the Rickey and G-Man mysteries. This one is more fun, and I believe, more finely crafted. There is less of the culinary aspect in this book, and more of the mystery-intrigue-New Orleans corruption "stuff', that makes these plots fun. Rickey is his usual impulsive and volatile self, and G-Man, ever steady and calming, evolves into a more complex and active character. Lenny is there, but he does not occupy too much of the book. There are a few surprising "twists" in the plot, and if you are an astute reader, you will "pick-up" the clues. If not, and that is VERY OK, you will find the resolution to the story line fascinating, and quite frankly, plausible. I'm looking forward to the "3rd" in the series, if there is to be one
4	4	I absolutely love Paula and this is the first cookbook of hers that I've bought. The book has a great layout (cakes, pies, cookies, bars, etc.) There are a few pictures (they are not on the same pages as their recipes) that make me want to bake even more! Everything in the book sounds so delicious but the thing that really got me was her pound cake. Now she has about 5 or 6 pound cake variations - I tried the cream cheese variation. Over the past 6 months I have been searching for "the" pound cake recipe and have tried a ton of different ones always with disappointment. When I tried Paula's I kept my expectations low and I was blown away!! It actually tasted like pound cake, not too sweet, not to floury--just perfect!!! I can't wait to try the rest of her recipes, for each ten I looked at I would deffinitely try at least 8 and consider the other 2! A minor disappointment is that some of her recipes call for pre-made cake mixes. Although it is great for cutting down on time I suppose, I don't see the sense in putting pre-made mixes into a cookbook. Still doesn't take away from the flavor or temptation of her desserts. Excellence
1	1	I bought this book on the recommendation of several people that I know pretty well, unfortunately, this book is filled with errors upon errors and is filled with a typical neo-confederate bias by the author. In fact, the book should be called "How confederates saved America" as he gives the credit for the peaceful return of the confederate armies to confederate generals such as Lee, Johnson and Forrest, rather than on Lincoln's instructions to Grant and Sherman and generous terms known as the River Queen Doctrine, "I want no one punished; treat them liberally all around. We want those people to return to their allegieance to the United States and submit to the laws". His errors are numerous. He talks of the possibility of the confederates disbanding their armies and moving into the hills and waging a guerilla warfare against the US troops and sights examples of how successful this tactic has been throughout time and he includes in these examples the American Revolution. He states that Francis Marion, Thomas Sumter and Andrew Pickens(who all could be called partisans or guerilla fighters), but then he goes on to state that Nathaniel Greene was a guerilla fighter as well. Now only someone completely ignorant of US Army history could ever make such a statement. Nathaniel Greene served in the Continental Army and was the Quartermaster General, he was in no way a guerilla, nor did he use guerilla tactics. He continues on that Greene used guerilla tactics in battle at Kings Mountain and Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse. Besides the basic fact that Greene wasn't even at the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, neither one could be said to be guerilla attacks. At Kings Mountain, the American militia found Patrick Ferguson and his men well entrenched in defenses at the crest of the mountain and formed up and attacked the positions, hardly a guerilla tactic. Cowpens was fought by Daniel Morgan and was a set piece battle where he destroyed Tarleton's legion. Greene attacked Cornwallis at Guilford Courthouse in another set piece battle and was winning until Cornwallis took the extreme measure of firing canister directly into the center of the two massed armies, killing and wounding as many of his own men as he did Americans. None of these battles were guerilla fighting and Greene in no way can be called a guerilla. The author shows his neo-confederate bias most clearly by restating the apocryphal stories of rape, theft and outright murder by Sherman's troops during the Savannah and Carolina Campaigns as matter of historical facts. He continually paints the Federals in the worst of lights, while reserving his highest praise and most eloquent prose for the confederates. He incorrectly quotes Sherman when he claims Sherman said "Sherman himself explained that in his march, he inflicted an astonishing $100 million worth of damage, of which only $20 million was necessary, the rest being "simply waste and destruction"". He clearly is slanting his own words to convince people that Sherman was in fact "the devil" as the neo-cons believe he is. Unfortunately, what he CLAIMS Sherman said has no relation to what he actually said. From the Official Records, Vol 44, page 13; in Sherman's report on his campaign to the War Dept, he states "I estimate the damage done to the State of Georgia and its military resources at $100,000,000; at least, $20,000,000 of which has inured to our advantage, and the remainder is simple waste and destruction." Sherman does not, as Mr. Winik claims state that only $20 million was necessary, what Sherman said was that his army confiscated and USED(inured means to use) $20 million worth of the property and destroyed the remaining $80 million of confederate civilian and private property that was going to be used against the armed forces of the United States. If you are a confederate "lost causer" then you will enjoy this novel, however, if you are looking for historical truth, then you should read a different book. William Hal
4	4	Both Guyton texts I received were manufactured defectively, coming unglued along the strap of the spine. Poor job, Saunders. Typical. Vander's Human Physiology is an excellent textbook in the sense that it answers all of the right questions at the right time, while you are studying. Also, more chemistry in Vander's, and in the long run that was important to me, since the atom is the basis of everything. Beautiful illustrations and photographs, and again, when compared to Guyton (where the illustrations were cheap and even shameful ... made by a high school art student?) the professional presentation and pedagogical context of Dr. Eric Widmaier's text was much better than the "Old" standard. Depth of coverage in some areas might be slightly less, but still the learning is there for the taking. I love this textbook, and I am convinced students studying from it will fair as highly on board examinations as those trying to learn from any other standard text in the field of introductory physiology.
0	1	Why of course the Chinese government was entirely to blame for the opium imported by the Scotsmen Jardine and Matheson! It just like when Americans have a cocaine problem, it is the US government, and not the drug smugglers and dealers, that has the responsibility. And if the Chinese folks got addicted to this narcotic, well, it's for their own good you know. At least that's Herman's view. Also, the Scots who thus created Hong Kong for the opium trade did not do all this hard work for money or for themselves. Yes, they did make a little money but that's not why they were in China. They imported opium in order to create Hong Kong so that one day it will become a "premier" commercial city of the Orient, with the ultimate goal of teaching China western financial and economic techniques. If it were not for Jardine and Matheson, how could China have become a great power today, or a candidate superpower tomorrow? No, these two far-sighted Scots had this noble, lofty goal in mind when they came to China, nothing lesss. When historians condemn these two for their "crime" (drug-dealing, that is) they forget that they are actually heroes, as Herman sees so clearly and correctly. And so it is completely unjust that a brilliant people like the Scots don't even have a country they can call their own while the "barbaric" and "decadent" Chinese do
1	4	"A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean." This is a book I have some trouble with. It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy. But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them. Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness
0	1	Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic
4	4	First issued in 1975, this book captures the magnitude and the magnificence of Chicago's architecture that has been destroyed (by nature and man). Today Chicago is widely regarded as an architectural jewel (and it is, I live there!) but after reading this book you won't be able to stop imagining how much more amazing the city might be if the Urban Renewal movement of the 1960s and early 1970s had never happened. If you are interested in architecture, Chicago history or urban design and planning, read this book
4	4	We were very pleased with our books. They were for christmas.And we recieved them in plenty of time. Im sure we will do business with Amazon again. Thank you so much..And Happy New Year
3	4	This is a thoughtful and well researched book. It answers some of the questions which bother most Indians are we aryans or dravidians, how did the indus valley civilization dissappear . The manner in which they explain the myths like the one about the vijayanagar empire tells us about the research put in by the authors. I would recommend this book to novices as well as connosieurs of Indian histor
4	4	This book, which is basically the memoirs of a young German soldier fighting in Russia during WWII, was tragic but fascinating. The language that young Willy Reese is beautiful and gripping. The young man who wrote this, in other words, was a prolific writer. He used captivating language and an unbridled vocabulary. His metaphors and allusions where breath taking and you never got bored from the raw detail that he used to describe the horrors of war. And with this book you also gain an unparalleled account of the horror and wickedness of fighting in the Eastern Front. I would recommend this book if you like WWII history or if you like to read a pseudo-prose poem and memoir with outstanding and fantastic language
0	4	This book is incredible! This author "poo-poos" any idea of Conspiracy as if it's in our deep inner mind. Just notice he equates it with "Paranoid". Does he think Bin Laden and his gang "conspired"? Well if you read one of Mr. Pipes other books, he certainly believes that, so I guess we can say he's paranoid. Conspiracies most likely are natural and normal, an abscence of conspiracy would be contrary to how individuals, nations and institutions work. Mr. Pipes ought to know that well. He's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, an organization which was founded by J.P. Morgan and has ties to the Federal Reserve Bank, which is a private bank: not Federal but a cabal of private bankers serving their own best interests. You can't join the CFR on your own--you must be invited! It's a club of the elite, by the elite for the elite. Every high ranking member of the Bush Admin is CFR: Hayden, Bush, Cheney, Rice, Rumsfeld, Powell, Paulson, Snow, etc, etc, also so is Ms. Clinton and many other ruling Democrats. Is this a coincidence, hardly! Compare Mr. Pipes book to Tim Carney's "The Big Ripoff", recently hosted on CSPAN book reviews and available on Amzaon. Tim gets close to the target by seeing the symptoms. Mr. Pipes writing of this book is highly suspect. One has to question his motives. It's like the Big Bad Wolf writing a book: How to Raise Chickens in a Hen House and Keep Them Safe. You would be better reading G. Edward Griffin's book: Creature from Jekyll Island-a second look at the Federal Reserve.
3	4	YOu must own Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs...please go buy that...then if you love that, you can get this book - which is a really nice sequal.. recommended
0	1	This is one of my favorite authors. I could hardly wait to open Burning Bright and get lost in London of the 1700's. Well, lost I got! Each page was more and more boring. I read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library. After reading the other reviews I am glad I didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending.
4	4	I'm updating my review, because I think the first draft was skimpy, and I feel like I have a better view of this book now that more time has passed since my first reading. The crux of the book is Guskin's concept of "taking it off the page." This was extremely valuable to me, and it turned cold readings from being scary to being my favorite part of the acting process! "Taking it off the page" is applicable to rehearsals, too, though, and to freshening up ongoing performances. The book lightly touches on a lot of different types of acting: Auditions, Rehearsals, Sit-Coms, Serials, Small Roles, Big Roles, Touring, Film Acting. I think Guskin wants to explain briefly what you need to do differently for each of these situations. The book is too short to teach all details for any of these, though, so you will need other sources. The book is very important to me, and my first experience with it was that I read it, and my very next rehearsal was the best rehearsal I had ever had. I felt so free, it was amazing. That is his main objective, to free you up to enjoy and explore.
4	3	Very interesting look at the the makeup of the New Hampshire primary and interesting facts and history
0	1	I was looking forward to reading The Exorcist but I was let down. The book is boring it doesn't go into any real depth when it comes to characters. The movie surpasses the book, I feel asleep while reading this book. Some people may feel that this book is scary but its only scary if you scare easily.
1	3	This book, published originally in three installments, is regarded as a turning point in graphic fiction, like DARK KNIGHT and WATCHMEN, but I just don't see it. Generally speaking, I like Gaiman's story lines, but this time it's all just confusing. The title character, a crime fighter superhero trying to infiltrate a mob, is killed in the first few pages -- but there's more of her back in the greenhouse so all is not lost. Or something. A newly hatched flower-woman, who seems to share some of the dead one's memories, sets out to uncover her identity. I think. The mob is run by Lex Luthor (why?), who wants to capture her and/or her little sister (or whatever) for dissection. But Carl, just out of prison, who used to work for Luthor and who previously murdered his wife, upon whom the orchids were based, can't get his job back and wants to get even with everyone. This guy is a loser and screw-up -- but suddenly, in the last installment, the action having relocated to the Amazon Basin, he becomes a very talented and successful jungle killer. (How?) Other people from the back-story weave in and out of the plot, including one who became the Swamp Thing, but none of what they say or do makes much sense. And why does Batman get a cameo? (Not to mentioned assorted bad guys from Gotham?) McKean's artwork is interesting for its own sake, owing more to oil painting than the usual sort of airbrush work, but all in all, I have to give this a shrug
0	1	When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along. This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice. Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book. It is self-indulgent and inane. If the use of the phrase "don't be rough," (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of "I love you, whatever that means," should do it. I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful
4	4	From the remarkable book structuring (the "chapters" are organized in alphabetical order) to the intriguingly insightful commentary, Seth Godin has once again created a work of excellence. The book is an easy read, but at the same time leaves the mind reeling with thoughts of "Oh my, I need to fix that, or do that, or change that." I found the chapter on "Clean Fire Trucks" particularly interesting, as I had just 2 months earlier finished an innovation article on "Retiring the Fire Trucks" -- which deals with the same concept of preventing fires and not letting them start in the first place! (As such, you can then have time to clean the fire trucks, or as I put it, to retire them altogether!). His rants are compelling yet at the same time hilarious (hilarious in the sense of all the silly things we do as a people that we really shouldn't be doing). Take for example his rant on "Wrappers" and how the method of packaging both the tangible and intangible create an aura around the product that determines how the product is perceived, received, and applied. One might say, "It's the WRAPPER, stupid." Once again, Mr. Godin has helped to "validate my existence" (despite my intense self-certainty!) by showing that the crazy, "outside the box" (hey, can we just shred the box, then burn it in effigy of the outdated strategies and the consultants who promote them?), simplifying, forward-looking, remarkable, visionary adventures we can lead our clients and companies on are really worth the effort. In short, less is more, small is big, and remarkable is just that: REMARKABLE. This book is REMARKABLE. I strongly encourage adding it to your shelf, then spreading the virus of its contents to others. P.S. The entire ending "Bonus Section" on blogs and other resources is something not to be missed, and single-handedly justifies the purchase
0	4	that this is such a religious book. I want my money back..
4	4	Satirical. Sarcastic. Ironic. Humorous. Salinger is the master at the concept of deriding and satirizing the elements of life. This book reveals the emotional roller coaster of a teenage boy's life. The story starts off with a moody teenager, Holden Caulfield. He is expelled from his third school, Pencey, and decides to hang around in New York City before heading back home. In New York, Holden experiences the highs and lows of his life. One minute, he is in a very elated state and then the next minute, he is down in the dumps. As Holden journeys through the nice neighborhoods to the slums in NYC, he realizes what the true world holds in store for him. Holden encounters run down hotels, clubs filled with losers, and plain old phoniness. But he also meets kind and generous people who, in a way, provide a light to Holden and shows him that the world isn't all that bad. Holden continually criticizes the phony life led by all those he knew through school and friends. When he tries to run away from it all, he encounters even more problems with money shortage, unfriendly people, and just plain bad luck which lead him to complain about everything. Salinger masters the art of satire to emphasize his message that being phony causes the person to lose their true identity and makes them assume another identity which they cannot live with at all. As Holden tries to rediscover himself and his values, he finds out that his life is not bad at all compared to the bunch of phonies he meets
4	4	One of the most wonderful things about Rabbi Kushner's writings is that he isn't afraid to tackle the hard questions. If we indeed have a Shepherd, why isn't He doing a better job? To this question, Kushner says, "the psalmist would teach us to see the world, without illusions that nothing bad will ever happen, but without the fear that we will be utterly destroy This is a lovely book full of hope and wisdom. Drawing on the individual lines of the Twenty-Third Psalm, Rabbi Kushner (known best for his book Why Bad Things Happen to Good People) creates 15 essays that are thought-provoking and inspiring. He outlines the historical background of the words of the psalm, noting "The earliest ancestors of the Hebrew People who gave us the Bible were nomads, owning no property, bound to no one location but traveling with their flocks and herds wherever there was pastureland for the animals to graze on." The analogy of God to a shepherd makes perfect sense in that environment. The beauty of the analogy is that it still speaks to us today. The image which is evoked is one of caring and greater knowledge. ed by the things that do happen." Kushner is skilled at relating Biblical literature to questions and concerns of today. He relates the verse to terrorists, Einstein and daily living. He provides insights and advice as to how we can live our lives more effectively. His words also provide hope to all of us: "You may have to work hard to earn your living...But you don't have to work hard in order to feel good about yourself. All you have to do is stop striving, relax, and say to yourself, I feel good about who I am." This slim volume will stay in a handy place in my home for years to come. It's a book I will come back to again and again for wisdom, courage and peace
0	4	F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life
1	1	This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next. However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives. A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband? It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research. That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book. I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it. It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure
4	1	Economist Joseph A. Schumpeter's keen intellect makes some of today's scholarship sound like the spouting of ideology on talk shows. Some consider him the greatest economist of the twentieth century. Only an intellect of his towering stature would be able to present a case that while Marx was wrong about how capitalism would collapse, he was probably correct that it eventually would. Schumpeter also contends that socialism may eclipse free-market economies, news he feels society should greet with angst. He believed that capitalism's doom would proceed not from a revolution by an angry proletariat, but rather as a result of successes that would give rise to a class of elites who would gradually institute systems of central control. Fully understanding this complex, although non-mathematical, treatise may require some background; it is not a book for the novice. While this 1942 classic may seem dated in spots, those who conclude that it is time to tap dance on socialism's grave should consider that Schumpeter expected socialism's dominance to take a century or more. We recommend this classic to anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the historic, economic case for the rise of socialism
0	1	I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom. The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy? This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it. I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published!
0	1	The book's case studies, code and build files assume that J2EE 1.4 comes with the PointBase database server. J2EE 1.4 currently only comes bundled with the Derby database server. As a result, the book is useless. Emails to the publisher failed to resolve the problem
0	4	Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil &quot;Red Man&quot; She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended
3	4	This is a great book, I found it full of excellent ideas on how to judge the appropriate pot and hand odds. Would have gotten a five star but is somewhat complex ar times
4	4	I love this book! I have read A-C so far, and this is my favorite book so far. It has a really strong plot, and a surprising ending. This crime book series is great, and I highly suggest picking this book up, or even starting with A
3	4	Written in 1948, this engrossing tale of a group of misplaced wartime Brits in a poor backwater in West Africa touches on so many human qualities that it is a chronicle of our mortality. Foremost is the perfectly presented portrait of a marriage that has turned into a lie for both Henry Scobie, the honest policeman of this coastal town, and his "literary" wife, Louise, who has become the object of pity and contempt for all the frustrated local British "club" members who constantly mind one another's business. Scobie no longer loves his wife but can't bring himself to hurting her. He simply pities her. And Louise no longer loves Henry and wants desperately to escape from West Africa, especially when she finds out that her "Ticki" has been passed up for promotion to Commissioner. The atmosphere becomes dark and twisted as a young man, Wilson, appears on the scene and, in his youthful stupidity, falls in love with Louise while he conducts secret investigations on British authorities suspected of aiding in the smuggling of industrial diamonds through Africa to Germany. Scobie is one of those suspects. A marvelously film noir portrait of a corrupt Syrian merchant, Yusef, is thrown into the mix. I can see Sidney Greenstreet doing this part to perfection in a screen adaptation. Add jealousy, desperation, a contrast of honesty and lies, sex, and the tortured feelings of a deeply religious man and you have most of what this novel contains. O yes, and then, as always, there's the brilliant writing of Graham Greene, his wonderful metaphors, crystal clear descriptions, and fantastic insights into the crabbed and self-defeating thought processes of his characters. All this equals a modern classic. My only complaint is a bit of redundancy and pedantry regarding Catholicism, a religion I cannot stomach anymore, and my personal disbelief that someone like Scobie can take Catholicism so seriously. But this is my own thing. Greene remains brilliant, original, and indeed, "the ultimate chronicler of twentieth-century man's consciousness and anxiety," or at least one of the top five
0	1	The newer editions of the Delorme Atlases are much inferior to, and skimpier on data, than their older editions. I assume they did this to save on printing costs. The maps contain only about half of the data that the older additions had. For example,in the new editions there are elevations listed for only the highest peaks, few of which are even named, and there is no data about mines or springs or many of the other features that the old editions included. Other than the newly added GPS coordiante data, they are just glorified road maps, which you can get at the gas station. I own several of these from many years back, but am very disappointed in the new editions
1	4	I was forced to read this book because of a teacher of mine, for a topic at the university. She came to the classroom with this book, as if it were the ultimate guide on teaching. First of all, I thought it's not a topic for the kind of subject we were having/discussing in the classroom. Secondly, the things the authors wrote are so obvious, at least for some persons, that all I can say is that I really had a very good time reading it as a comic book, nothing else. I laughed very much with all the explanations a teacher would give to a 7 or 9 year-old pupil, because he touched her on the arm. It was a lecture, not a simple explanation! Clearly we have to be polite, encouraging and nice towards the students. But this book really exagerates some points in such a foolish way, that I could only laugh. I never had problems with students in my classes, I always tried to encourage them to like the subjects; I am sure they learned many things, as well as I learned from them, too. This book was just a waste of time. The worst thing is that the teacher I am talking about, the one who came to the classroom telling how wonderful the book is, doesn't practice what the book preaches! She is hated at the university and never behaves as the book says to. How is it possible? She didn't learn anything from it??? Maybe it's good for people who are starting a teaching career - then I would say read it, but even though I would be very cautious. But being recommended by someone who does exactly the contrary than the book states, I could imagine it wouldn't really be that good.
4	4	Equipped with a keen intuition, great confidence, and credentials stacked sky high, Kate Solisti - Mattelon steps up and ably swats one home for the dog lover in us all. She has long understood that dogs run the wide and crooked. It's we humans who took the broad view and tried to fit it into the straight and narrow scope of understanding. An awkward fit at best, if not totally improbable. She presents her material simply, in a parable format of sorts to help us understand the heart and mind of man's best friend. Repeated readings pay off. Myself, having to resolve grief issues on having to put my thirteen years old Siberian Husky, Riva to sleep this past summer. I now know without doubt that my favorite life companion is a part of me forever. This book can and should be a part of you. Highly enjoyable. Highly recommended
4	4	My son is 8 and although he is a great reader (has read all of the Harry Potter series more than once), he wanted me to read this one to him. I have to say we both enjoyed it equally. I would agree to a chapter or two every other night or so, but found myself agreeing to "just one more chapter" on a regular basis. It was nice to find something we both liked and looked forward to. What an imaginative tale. Now I need to get the rest of the series..
4	4	I assign this book to students in my psychology seminar. These students at a women's college tell me that they find Women and Desire to be thought provoking, interesting, even helpful. I noticed a column in Newsweek by Anna Quindlen in October. She argued that women today still need the F word feminism because society hasn't changed as much as we like to tell ourselves. It appears that the need for books such as this one by Polly Young-Eisendrath continues to be valid
4	4	Following a worldwide plague, Robert Neville may be the only man left alive. His family is dead. All the surviving humans have been transformed into vampires that surround his house very night in an attempt to break in or entice him out, attack him, and drink his blood. Holed up in his home, which he has converted into a safe house, Robert struggles with his despair and his outsider status, the constant need to seek shelter, food and protection, and the desire to discover the cause and possibly the cure of the plague. A combination of science fiction and horror, I Am Legend is an atmospheric, stark survivalist text with a truly brilliant central concept: the scientific conception and explanation of a vampire. The book is short and difficult to put down, well paced, both intelligent and frightening, and had a huge literary impact on authors in both the sci-fi and horror genres. I highly recommend it, and I consider it one of the most interesting books that I have ever read. This read through of I Am Legend was my first time coming back to it since I read it in high school (now almost four years ago). The story has stayed very fresh in my mind over the intervening years--or, more precisely, the science of Matheson's conception of vampires. Coming back to the text, it is now very obvious to me why those aspects would stick with me so strongly. For the most part, this narrative is a method of conveying Matheson's sci-fi concepts--perhaps like any true SF author, he puts scientific concept ahead of character, and the most important aspect of the characters is not their personality or emotions but rather then impact that the story's scientific concept has on them. In the case of I Am Legend, that concept is a scientific and (mostly) logical explanation for vampires. And it's a wonderful, brilliant concept, more than unique and interesting enough for me to remember it in detail over the years. I still feel like the final development to this sci-fi idea and its repercussions happens too quickly and in limited detail, making the end of the book feel a little too fast--nonetheless, the concept is a great one, and very interesting to read about. The flips side of that situation, however, is that the book lacks characterization and emotion. Those aspects aren't entirely absent by any means. Robert, the protagonist, has a back story, goes through emotional phases, and is greatly impacted by the apocalyptic survival setting that he finds himself in. He's realistically faulted and in many ways admirable. Nonetheless, these personal characteristics and even his interactions, past and present, exist primarily to move towards, expound on, and explain Matheson's scientific point, his conception of the vampires. In some cases, this is obvious: Richard's memories serve to build his character, but they also serve to lead him, and thus the reader, to a better understanding of the vampires. At a mere 160 pages, Matheson could have chosen to give greater emphasis to character--not so that it overwhelmed his SF ideas, but so that it provided a counterbalance to the emphasis on plot and idea found throughout the rest of the book. The lack of realistic and independently meaningful character makes those sections of the book unmemorable and makes the book as a whole a little bit too fast and too simple as a result. Despite these thoughts and critiques, I greatly enjoy this novel and highly recommend it. Matheson achieves an incredible atmosphere in I Am Legend, one of constant paranoia and terror that never grows stale or overblown. His SF concepts are detailed, intelligent, and truly absorbing. The book combines horror and sci-fi in a way that I have never seen anywhere else and find greatly enjoyable to read. I highly recommend the text, and it's a good one to own--although short and easily readable, it's wonderful to come back to and reread. It also makes a great atmospheric yet intelligent horror/Halloween text. I haven't read the additional texts that accompany the 300-page version, and so I can't speak for those
0	1	There's nothing in this book that isn't in many other photography books. Much of the book is taken up with definitions and discussion of equipment and techniques, rather than approaches to creativity (as is implied by the sub-title of the book). The photos are far from inspiring. I didn't learn anything from this book
4	4	Jolly Captain Jack Aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian Doctor Maturin Return for this 7th book in the renowned Aubrey/Maturin series. In this segment, Maturin and fem fatale Diana Viller's romance heats up, Jack's money troubles become more pronounced, and Doc Maturin's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him. What can I say about this great series? The character of Jack Aubrey is just SO endearing and Doctor Maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor, that this series simply cannot be missed! Even the presence of Diana Villers (a character I've simply loathed for quite some time), seems less irritating. I'm listening to the unabridged Narrated version by Patrick Tull, and this series is wonderful. Cannot be missed. Particularly love the parts where Jack/Maturin and The Swedish Envoy are in prison. Too funny! Wonderful series. I highly recommend it.
4	4	Highly recommended for personal insights. Densely packed with information clarifying difficult concepts. This book will give you some clear insights into things you may not have received along the way and how to get past those. Although it is thin, the book has an incredibly large amount of information in it. This is the kind of book you will read the first time with an expression of "Wow" on your face. It will then be something that you will be drawn back to read again and again. Even if you don't feel you "missed anything" along the way, the books insights and examples will provide great insights to you. It will provide great understanding of the self and others, therefore anyone can benefit from reading it. If you liked Fromm's The Art Of Loving you will love this book as well. The premise of this book being, we are all gifted and it is up to us to reclaim that understanding. EXCELLENT self-help material
4	4	I just reread it recently as an adult. I had this boxed set of three hardcover E.B. White books when I was a kid - Charlotte's Web, The Trumpet of the Swan (which I remember as my favorite of the three, though I hardly remember it today), and Stuart Little. I was so happy when the cheap paperback they ordered here was the same printing - same illustrations and everything. Anyway, coming back to it as an adult (or sort of adult) was surprising - it was so beautifully laid out, the tone, the story, the dark deep themes - as a short novel, it stands with the best of literature. I know there's no such thing as a "perfect" novel, but as far as any literary criteria can be applied, it is absolutely beautiful - symmetrical in all the right places, gentle as it deals with the harshness of life, all the dark undertones - the sheep in the background with their collective understated cruelty, Templeton the amoral hedonist, the cruelty of time that makes little girls grow up - and yet somehow tenderness persists. It's elegant and real and cosmic and full of quaint Americana. Certainly not only for children. A fine novel by any standards
4	4	If you want the opposite of James Frey--that is, if you want to read beautiful, true prose that doesn't flinch from the deeper truths, read Caldwell. This is a book about West Texas, growing up, leaving home, struggling with family, remembering the farm, hating Vietnam, going to Mexico, reading great books, moving forward. I put a pot of coffee on and read through the night, then passed it on to my Dad, who did the same. Thanks, Ms. Caldwell.
0	1	While well written this work is simply another example of historical revisionism. Not really worth the time.
0	1	This review refers to the Audio-book. I'm a huge James Lee Burke fan, but I found the reading of this book to be unbearable. I have listened to Mark Hammer read before and have enjoyed his renditions of other authors like Elmore Leonard, but here he just sounds tired, sloppy and unconvincing as a Cajun reader. His performance is unidimensional and lacks any variety. When he attempts to mimic a southern accent it sounds like someone from Detroit imitating Gomer Pyle. Towards the end of the reading, it sounded like he needed to clear his throat. If you want to hear a stellar reading, try another James Lee Burke work "Purple Cane Road" read by Will Patton.
1	1	The best part about this book was the intro. In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction. The rest of the book is a chore to read. The confusing and tedious writing style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make. Someone should have counseled Mr. Bloom that "Brevity is the soul of wit."
4	1	I hesitated ordering this book because a previous reviewer reported that he had found the binding to be inferior. Perhaps this was true in previous bindings, but the copy I recently obtained looks fine in this regard and should stand up to heavy use for some years to come. I'm finding this an excellent disctionary in all regards, though as a beginner I have not put it to lots of use. Basically I use the New Nelson, with this dictionary as a supplement, especially for compounds. And there are times when this alternate system of radical identification is just easier than the traditional system.
0	1	I wish I had not purchased this item. Not user friendly--confusing to use for a novice.
1	1	Has some good topics discussed. Would not recommend this book as a starter in labor law
3	4	A good read. Hurston does an excellent job of depicting the parallel experiences of the captivity of the Israelites and the American Slave. In fact, one could argue that the experience of the Israelites is the American Slave experience. This is a great book for high school reading, it provides a variety of cause and effect themes that all young adults need to know; among them, if you oppress a people or person you breed fear, insecurity, and eventual self hatred in that human. I highly recommend Their Eyes Were Watching God another of Hurston's literary jewels. jewels
3	4	A quick, efficient reference with the most commonly used words for students on the go
4	4	Great Book, couldn't put it down until I finished it! If you like the history of how a great race car was born and how three special guy's, Wilbur Shaw, Ted Horn and Cotton Henning made the Masarati 8CTF a legend, get this book! This car was a winner in 1939-40, should have won in 1941, and finished no worse than 4th from 1946 to 1948. It was still competing in the 500 until 1951
1	1	George has always been my favorite Beatle. I have been celebrating his birthday and got the Concert for george Harrison and watched it on his deathdate, and even wrote my 6th grade biography on him. So, I turned to this book. There were plenty of grammatical errors and false information. I think that it said in the front that he didn't "hassle any of the beatles for this information" then how could he even get information such as this. Go to I, Me, Mine it's a better book because its WRITTEN BY HARRISON HIMSELF!
4	4	Nicola writes in such a spare and poetic style that she must capture the imagination of each child who reads it, or has it read to her. She offers facts about this bat breed as she weaves her story, and topped with delicate artwork, it's just perfect
0	3	what can you expect from one traitor? hi vill pay for this
1	1	First, FIX THE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION AMAZON!!!!! In spite of Loopy's warning I ordered this book in hopes he had just received old inventory. Wrong! I received the same 1995 book and when I complained to Amazon they sent me a replacement. Another 1995 book. While the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. The Clark Fork, for example, is described as "teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin." My online research has indicated the Clark Fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide I would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip. If this book were up to date I would give it at least 4 stars. But considering the age I would recommend you pass and search for other sources
4	4	NEED I SAY MORE? if you've seen the movie.. you MUST read this book... the fact that it is nearly word for word.... BLEW ME AWAY... Frank's writting and art style is flawless... keep it up... i'm lookin forward to Sin city 2... (...2007?... i hope!!!!!
4	3	Dr. Glinsky managed to write a complete factual book and yet have all the action and suspense that you would commonly find in an espionage novel
4	4	This book is a wonderful examination of the social history of knitting. Knitting for family has always been a requirement of any woman. But, this book revels how woman across America knitted items in support of the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, WWI and WWI. In fact, there is currently a program to knit scarves in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Knitting for charity is also discussed. When our governments can not, or will not, provide for the needy; American's women have
0	1	I generally don't enjoy reading books with teenaged legs and sunflowers on the cover. I often read on the subway, and it can be a bit embarassing. If I chose to weather the pornographic implications of such cover art, I expect to be rewarded for my sacrifice--with, say--A GOOD BOOK. I'd even settle for full characters who change and grow. I'd settle for dialogue that occasionally rose above tediousness and pointlessness--perhaps dialogue that, in fact, advanced the plot or advanced character development. If I am going to sit on the L train with a book that slightly resembles a Baby-Sitters Club Epic, I would like for that book to be enriching/rewarding/entertaining/redeeming. Why is this book 400 pages long??!!!! Nothing happens. The family has the same conversations over and over again, and nothing ever changes, and the father character is so irresponsibly designed that his dialogue is virtually identical to that of her 31-year-old boyfriend, Oliver. No one comes alive, except maybe the mother. I found almost nothing to hold on to in the entire novel. The opening line was intriguing. From there on out, it becomes progressively worse. I felt only for one person: the mother. Because she sat in the background, hands folded meekly, kind of depressed and annoyed, for the entire book. Which was a lot like how RR made me feel, too
4	4	In Women &amp; Christianity, educator and author Mary Malone examines the chronic and pervasive ambivalence towards women throughout the first thousand years of Christianity. While women from the very beginnings of the Christian Church have been graced, called, inspired, and canonized down through the centuries, they have also been excluded and even oppressed by clergy and other leaders of the Christian community who cited scripture and Christian tradition (including Apocryphal and Gnostic literatures) as the justifying source of their discrimination. Very highly recommended for women's studies and students of Christian history from 30 C.E. to 1002 C.E. (the &quot;Dateline&quot; section is particularly noteworthy), Women &amp; Christianity showcases both the persistent courage and the innovative quality of women's lives, as well as offering a critical analysis of previous conventional histories. The clear emphasis throughout is the enduring importance of women's contributions to the creation of Western culture in general, and the evolving Christian community in particular
4	4	I am loving this book, but let's get one thing straight. This is not a cupcake book, as the cover would lead you to believe. In fact, I only saw one reference to a cupcake from a regular layer cake recipe, even though it is written by one of the owners of New York's famed Magnolia Bakery, which has gained notoriety for its cupcakes. At any rate, the recipes contained in this book are pure magic. So far I have made the white layer cake with chocolate chips and peanut butter icing (as suggested), and it was quite a hit with friends and family. Other recipes I'm going to try in the next few days are the sour cream coffee cake and the buttercup golden layer cake. This book is all about making things from scratch like they did in the olden days, but you could also mix and match homemade cakes with store-bought icing or vice-versa. Read the introductory section with tips and pay attention to the details (e.g., use cake flour instead of all-purpose or self-rising, use butter/sour cream at room temp., etc.), which will make all the difference. The section with icing recipes is short but covers a variety of flavors. It's definitely not an Atkins-friendly cookbook or any of that, so you know it's good for your sweet tooth! I would definitely recommend this book to any baker, novice or expert, and am looking forward to buying 'The Magnolia Bakery Cookbook' (co-authored by Appel) next
1	4	This is a beautiful but creepy book: a lost sheep all alone, terrified by UFOs no less into fleeing into a strange, deserted home, is not my ideal bedtime reading for a sensitive child. The strong colors are beautiful and a nice change from baby-pastel, but they are also ominous and deterring. His utter solitude, in exploring the house (creepy corridor with blood-colored doors), eating, and finally sleeping, is horrifying to a child with imagination, whose most overriding terror is abandonment. I give it points for beauty and originality, none for sensitivity to the needs of its target audience, and cannot recommend it
4	1	Rashid Khalidi is the Edward Said Chair in Arab Studies at Columbia University: his Resurrecting Empire: Western Footprints And America's Perilous Path In The Middle East blends history, current events and social issues in a penetrating examination of America's growing involvement in Middle East affairs. Chapters document the history of such involvements and the likely outcome of the latest, drawing on the author's vast political knowledge to paint a more damning picture than most. A 'must' for any serious about Middle East affairs.
1	1	I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers. But this story is just way too slow. Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again. I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner. About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading. I just couldn't get into the characters. I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.
3	4	Mr. Galvan's writing about a piece of property, at first, seems strange; however, as you read you become absorbed. He writes of much more than the land, he writes of the people who live that land. It takes a special person to live in the wilds of Wyoming, and an extrodinary person to live in the isolated, rugged, raw, and unforgiving areas. This is a book I have given as a gift to many individuals who know what it is truly like to live here in Wyoming, want to live here, or seem to possess that independence and creativity needed to live here
4	4	This book is not only an interesting read, but fun as well! The pictures detail everything from each step of refurbishing a sailboat, including what tools to use and how to use them. I just ordered 3 more copies and can't wait to give them to my boating enthusiastic friends! Whether your re-doing a sailboat or not, I would highly recommend this to anybody who's into boating.
1	1	back and forth and back and forth. im happy. im sad. happy. sad. love him. dont love him. love him. dont blah. blah blah. we're poor. we're not poor. we're poor. a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas. malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive). spoiler he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok! (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no. when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok. the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad. in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)
0	1	To prove America is a Christian nation David Barton cites the little known blasphemy conviction of Abner Kneeland. During the 1830s Kneeland,a former Universalist turned pantheist, was sentenced to sixty days in a Boston jail for ridiculing the deity of Christ. Barton cites Commonwealth v. Abner Kneeland as example of how early American jurisprudence defended Christianity. Either David Barton is a sloppy scholar or he is a man with a scary agenda. Does Barton believe that state governments should have the power to jail people for stating religious opinions contrary to his? Why else would he cite the Kneeland case? Kneeland should only be a curious anachronism, not a legal precedent.
4	4	This resource tool serves as a practical, easy to use guidebook for the work our teachers do designing performance assessments that parallel State assessments. Spence has the ability to take complex concepts and translate them so that practitioners can make sense of the research and best practices. This is a &quot;must read&quot; for teachers striving to increase academic achievemnet for all students
3	4	Doug Montgomery got excellent statistical training at VPI. He also has a wealth of practical experience from his consulting work. His books on regression, statistical design and response surfaces are all well written and understandable to engineers. This 4th edition published in 1997 still contains all the useful information on factorial and fractional factorial designs. Chapter 14 is a wonderful up-to-date chapter that covers important process optimization topics not often covered in traditional design of experiments books. This includes response surface methods, mixture experiments, evolutionary operation and Taguchi methods. It does not require high level mathematics
4	4	This is a great journey into Narnia. I enjoyed every book and every chapter. I know everyone I talked to has read this book as a child, I think they need to re-read as an adult and really dig deeper into each chapter.
4	4	Way better than most art books, Covers so many necessary points. The author has a great website too
4	4	This book has fascinating events happening all the time. I couldn't even blink one second away from it. Even though this book was used for a project, it was far more for me than homework... This book really teaches true lessons that all of us, young the elders need to learn. Especially from Johnny Raven's point of view. The story plot was fascinating... how many times did i use that word..? Well it is truly is...
0	1	I have enjoyed reading other books by Mr. Prosek, however, this one was a true disappointment. I couldn't figure out if this was a book about fishing or drinking. There seemed to be more anecdotes regarding drinking and getting soused than any fishing action. Even if the author loves to drink, the book is supposed to be about fishing the 41st parallel and all that that should entail. I may not have learned much about trout fishing, but I sure know where to find booze joints along the 41st parallel
0	1	My impression was that this tape contained the most basic ideas that author's in this subject matter have ever presented. For eg., &quot;People crossing hands in front of their chest means that they aren't accepting what you are telling them.&quot; That is the most typical statement I have ever heard, and this tape is full of them. There is nothing enlightening, nothing that makes you glad that you bought and listened to the tape. I felt it was not good use of time or money. Fo
1	4	Don't read this book. I wish I hadn't. It ruined Pete Rose in my eyes, not because of what others have said about him, but because of what Rose said about himself. My grandpa was a huge fan of Pete Rose and once took me to meet him at Riverfront Stadium when I was around six. About the only thing I'm glad for with this book is it didn't come out in my grandpa's lifetime. We all make mistakes. We're only human and that's what humans do: we screw up. Sometimes badly. I wish Pete Rose was in the Hall of Fame. I wish he was coaching the Reds today. I wish most of all he'd never placed a single bet on baseball. But as for Pete, like I said up there, he still doesn't get it, and I doubt he ever will. This book was a disappointment for many reasons. It did give me a nice look at Pete's career with the Cincinati Reds and took me back to my grandfather's tales of how great the Big Red Machine of the 1970's was, but what was lacking in these 322 pages was contrition, and I think that was supposed to be what this book was about. The Pete Rose I met in My Prison Without Bars, was a likable fellow, but underneath his trip down memory lane was a sort of combative, "this is somebody else's fault" attitude that put me off and I'm sure put a lot of others off, too. Rose admits at last that he in fact bet on baseball during the 1980's, a fact that surprised virtually no one, but instead of presenting an apology, or even a straightforward confession, Rose comes across as a bitter man, still trying to squirm away from his wrongdoing. He blames everyone from his friends and business associates, to Major League baseball (for not forgiving his gambling addiction as it did the drug and alcohol addicitons of other players). Rather than presenting the public with his mea culpa, Charlie Hustle, the greatest baseball player of his era, left me feeling negative toward him, and thinking he is a slightly unintelligent crook. Those were not images I had of the man before I started this book and I'm sorry that's how I felt when I was done. If I could say something to the man whose life is the subject of this work, I'd tell him: Pete, you've led an interesting sixty-plus years. You're one of the greats and a hometown hero for what you did on the field. You deserve to be in Cooperstown. But your attempt to make amends with this book---probably your last chance, sadly--is a dismal failure and a backset. I remember well the night you passed Ty Cobb's all-time hitting record. I read this mostly to acquaint myself with a player about whom I heard so much growing up. I now wish I didn't know 4/5ths of what I now do know about you. As I said starting out: don't read this book
4	4	`Notes From The Underground' is a formidable work of philosophy and of psychology, not to mention its worth as a novel. In the space of around one hundred pages, Dostoyevsky manages to expound theories on reason, alienation, suffering, and human inaction. The book's importance and influence on generations of writers cannot be over-emphasised; Sartre and Camus are only two examples of people who have been directly influenced by this book. The book is presented in two parts. Part one `Underground' is written in the form of the nameless narrator's rambling thoughts on reason and his claim that throughout history, human actions have been anything but influenced by reason. Underground Man's charge is that man values most the freedom to choose to act in opposition to reason's dictates. Dostoyevsky's critique of reason then, although it demands attention and is somewhat difficult to follow, sets the philosophical foundations for the rest of the book. Part two `A Propos of the Wet Snow' is much easier to read, as the narrator recounts three episodes which happened when he was fifteen years younger and working as a civil servant in St. Petersburg. The first considers an incident in which an army officer insults him and goes on to detail Underground Man's subsequent internal anguish at his inability to commit an act of retribution. The second episode takes place at a farewell dinner for an acquaintance named Zverkov. The narrator is utterly disgusted with the company in which he finds himself but despite this, he is unable - even though he desires it - to make them realise this. The third episode details Underground Man's brief, painful and emotional relationship with a prostitute. Dostoyevsky is refreshing in this book thanks not only to his incredibly powerful prose, but also for the intense but subtle way in which the stories reflect and indeed embody his philosophical theories. This dark and pessimistic portrayal of the nature of man may not sit very comfortably with many readers, however the ideas expressed in `Notes From The Underground' are as relevant and worthy of deliberation now as I am sure they were in 1864.
0	1	Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked
1	4	As a huge fan of Jim Henson, the Muppets, and Kermit the Frog I was hugely disappointed. The recaps of Jim Henson's life and Kermit's were interesting, but the rest was trite nonsense
3	4	Reader beware - 800 plus pages, so this is no book for story time. Extremely prolific, James A. Michener writes as only he can write about the Caribbean, that vast expanse of ocean surrounded by Cuba, Puerto Rico and the extensive small islands smattered across the seascape. This is a powerful history of these islands, and James Michener takes us from the 1300s when a peaceful tribe of Arawaks are horribly destroyed all the way to Castro's Cuba. This is the sort of book one would do better learning about this area from, as the author weaves plot upon plot into a brilliantly masterminded historical novel. You will learn more from this book about the Caribbean Sea and its islands than any history or geography class could give you, and you will have more fun doing it! I gave it four stars simply because with a book this size, there was bound to be some dreadfully boring parts, and there were. If it were a bit shorter in length it would lack nothing but a Pulitzer
3	4	In school my class and I read the book the Wish Giver. This book is about three kids who each receive a magic card from a small, chubby, mysterious little man named Thaddeus Blinn. When each child makes a wish , the wish turns out the wrong way. The moral of the story is "Be Careful what you wish for". This was a very interesting book. I really enjoyed it. Bill Brittain was a wonderful author. I highly reccomend this book.
4	4	her abilities affect her, then this diary will interest you. Ms. Choquette comes across as a charming, friendly person whom one would love to have over for dinner. She writes about her parents (especially her mother) and how her large family was close and sort of quirky. She describes her early psychic experiences and her training with two teachers who open her abilities up even more and teach her about life. The most enjoyable part of the book for me was the descriptions Sonia gave of clients, mostly from the 70s -- lime green hot pants, bouffant hairdos, tie-dyed t-shirts and platform shoes...those were the days...how did anyone get a date back then? The only criticism I have about the book is that Ms. Choquette mentions several times that her family was Catholic and religiously so. I do not doubt her family's religious sensbilities, but the Church teaches against almost everything that Sonia practices and believes -- reincarnation, clairvoyance, ascended masters, divination with tarot cards, spirit guides, etc. I don't think it is possible to be a Catholic in the sense of someone who believes in the dogmas of the Church and be a New Ager as Sonia is. She also says that she prayed the rosary before her readings and one of her teachers said that she would attract only good spirits that way, but she also needed to pray the Our Father. The rosary requires the recitation of the Our Father at least 6 times, so I was confused when Sonia said she then began to pray the Our Father as well. I wonder what rosary she was praying.
0	4	This book doesn`t compare very well with any other recipe books you will have seen - there are no pictures of the finished dishes for a start. A lot of the "celebrities" you won`t have heard of - that shouldn`t matter if the recipes are good. Its a very American book and doesn`t travel well; the quantities are measured in "cups", oven temps quoted in Fahrenheit only and products not available anywhere else (what are "graham crackers"??) There are lists at the back of bands with food names and songs with food names (brilliant journalism girls) and the authors thank you pages are hilarious - thanking their cats and themselves for the joy-filled experience of working with each other. I realise a recipe book has to have some simple ones included, but Hot Rod Hot Dogs - buy some hot dog sausages, buy some white buns, add some relish and mustard. Enjoy! Peanutbutter on Toast Sandwiches, buy some peanutbutter, toast some bread. Enjoy! They`re having a laugh, aren`t they? But this book is supporting a charity. It doesn`t actually say how much of the proceeds are going to Freedom From Hunger, just "some".....so I suggest you give your donation directly to the charity instead of buying thi
1	1	Like many people, I bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, Amadeus, and the truth. I am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. The effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which I'm not particularly interested in. It may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. How do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? I'm sure some of Solomon's conclusions are valid but I kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book I had left to go so I could say I finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable
1	1	Back in his day Heinlein was the greatest writer of science fiction for adolescent boys. Unfortunately, that day is long past, and Heinlein has wandered far from his strength. This book fills in some gaps from Time Enough for Love and is a rehash of much of that story from an alternate viewpoint. As was the case in Time Enough for Love, sexual coupling of old men and young girls is a recurring theme. Examples: The two female lead characters brag to one another how they had their first sexual experience at ages 12 and 14 and with men 4 times their age. The male lead goes back in time and has sex with his sister, then a young teen, and he, at this point, the oldest man in human history. To make all this go down easier, the young females are the sexual aggressors and the old men are pursued, and said to be 'tripped' if she has her way with him. There is a lot more of this 'weird sex', but I will move on. This is not really a science fiction story per se, but there are a few trappings of science fiction used to decorate the story. Most of it takes place in the first half of the 20th century in mid America. There isn't really a plot. The book is a series of anecdotes occuring in the life of this unlikely heroine, seemingly Heinlein's feminine ideal. It is obvious that the author has run out of ideas at this late point in his career. This book would not have been published if it was the work of an unknown author.
1	1	I genuinely wanted to like this book. However, the arguments put forward are so deeply biased by Goldhagen's strong views on the subject as to be worth little in granting the reader greater understanding of the Holocaust. It doesn't read like a history book and I wasn't surprised to learn (afterword) that the author is not a historian. That said, there is value in reading it. The book is rich in facts and detail, the result of some indepth research. However, the way the author uses (and abuses) these facts left me wanting to stop reading in frustration. The book is filled with 'Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc' arguments and mental gymnastics designed to prove Goldhagen's hypothesis. Millions of non-Jewish victims are for the most part ignored in this work, but it still can be worth a read. But, only if you are not put off by reptitive, awkward prose and are prepared to seperate the rich collection of data from the author's emotionally driven interpretations
0	4	I really do congratulate Bill Rancic for being HIRED by one of the richest man in the world. But being hired does not mean that Bill Rancic just became the next Bill Gates or Warren Buffet. Great to know that you take yourself VERY VERY highly Mr.Rancic. your going to fit fine in the Trump Organization, But seriously dont over do yourself. I'd rather retake my 'X100 intro to business administration' class in my college than to buy this book
0	3	I had to force myself to finish this book. I don't allow myself to move onto a new read until I've finished the one that I've started, and this by far was the most difficult to get through. The dialogue between characters is laughable, the promising plot points are either too rushed or go on for far too long thereby destroying any bit of excitement that could be felt from them. Ted Bell's description and background on these characters makes them too unbelievable either by allowing them every positive characteristic (Alex Hawke) or changing their characteristics when its convenient (bin Wazir). There is nothing endearing about this novel, I honestly cannot believe this book was ever a bestseller. Do yourself a favor, bypass this book and read the 007 series by Ian Fleming.
1	1	I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it. I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point. There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance. While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better
3	4	Maybe it is a strange focus for a book of social studies, not just describing how people talk about themselves, but how they talk about each other. In the end, I think this is the most interesting part of the book, what it tells us about the gossip of Shanghai people. As a person who grew up in Shanghai and left eight years ago, I am drawn to all stories of Shanghai out of nostalgia and curiousity for my old home. So I bought this book in the university book store. What I found is an unusual type of story, written by a foreign, well American, man about sex in Shanghai. Some things he writes are so familiar to me I laughed out loud. Others are not what I remember of Shanghai. I like best the stories these people tell about their friends. I remembered some of the stories in my street, and it made me laugh
3	4	There was a time when Stephen King was one of my favorite authors. Then I started hanging out with a better class of authors, hehe. But now, he is once again one of my favorite authors. As I said before, he's raised his game. ON WRITING and everything after. If it's a re-issue of an oldie, well, it has a new introduction by the guy who wrote ON WRITING, and that alone makes it worth buying again. Truly, I love every word he's published for the past five years. The guy was already (perhaps) the best seller of all time, and he wasn't satisfied. How great is that? What we have here is a collection of 14 short stories, some just creepy/scary and others literary. It's a wonderful mix of what we've always known he excels at and what we may not have realized he excels at. Several months back, I heard some scary rumors to the effect that he might retire. That is not allowed. Stephen, if you retire, I'm gonna round up Annie Wilkes and we're gonna make you shave Picasso's neck. So there!
1	1	This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation. If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress &amp; strain book its more poorly written then the Marks
4	4	I just wanted to add another vote of confidence for this marvelous dictionary. I got through 4 years of college Latin with it, and almost never failed to find the word I was looking for. I particularly appreciate the idiomatic expressions highlighted in bold typeface, to make it easy to skim down the definition to find the one you're looking for. Its only downfall is that, as a paperback, it begins to get a bit well-thumbed, leading the serious Latinist to think, a little wistfully, that it would be nice if it came in a hardbound edition. But for a mere six bucks, you can easily afford to buy a replacement. Personally, I own two
4	1	The author of the chapter 1- Robert H.Heusen is sincere at p.2 saying that other local ethnicities were indigeneous to the area where Armenia was established much later-e.g.the Khaldeans,the Urartians etc.;that ancient authors wrote about it clearly.I would add that Strabo in the Ic.wrote in his Geography of the World that the Armenian political unit was created by a certain general of the army of another country on the land snatched from the Iberians/Moskhians; this is in vol 5 of Strabo,the Loeb Classical Library edition in 1936;this is the area where the Republic of Armenia was created in 1918.I recently learned that its name was planned to be 'Republic of Erevan'(not Armenia) and the League of the Nations promised to the government of Kartu i.e. Georgia that the creation of Armenia in Caucasia was a temporary measure-F.Nansen from that League of the Nations desired to create some footing somewhere in the world for refugees driven out from the Balkans and that soon the League of the Nations would move the Republic of Armenia and her Armenian and other refugees-unwanted citizens of Turkey-to the Mediterranean.These facts are known from materials published by F. Nansen available in English and some translated into Russian now on the web.The creation of that republic and that of Azerbaijan in 1918 in the area was the gross violation of the human rights of the indigeneous nation called by several names:the Iberians,the Moskhians,the Kardi etc. R.Heusen is absolutely right in telling readers that even before World War I,the Armenians were a minority in what became the Republic of Armenia in 1918.After reading those truthful remarks it was a sad surprise to me to see on the next page "a map of the historical Armenia" encompassing greater territory than the Great Britain.R.Heusen wrote the former was 238,000 square miles against 228,000 square miles of the latter.The term Armenian Plateau is frequently used by the author.It is unwelcome as other names were usually used for that plateau.Moses Khorenatsi is discussed at several pages.It is over two centuries that he is widely denounced for being a fictitious author and therefore called Pseudo-Moses Khorenatsi.I have thoroughly researched materials on that author in publications,in unpublished archives of Prof.Mikheil Tamarashvili known as Michele Tamarati in Rome and Paris.Many authors in XIX century revealed the absurdity of the writings attributed to him:among them Mr.Lenormann,Ilia Chavchavadze criticised that pseudo author and his promoters from the Mkhitarist congregation in Venice- Western Europe for spreading false information.'Gate of Alans' (p.152)usually has a better term in historical sources:the Gate of Aragvi.Metsamor mentioned at p.49 is the distorted term from Kartu term 'Metsamuli' meaning 'Cherry colour'-as nearby clyffs are reddish with minerals.This Kartu/Kartuli designation was given to those clyffs,the nearby village and the river by ethnic Kartu population millenia ago before aliens-Armenians among them-immigrated to that area-some as refugees,others as invaders accompanying alien armies.Authors of this book mention a huge number of writings of persons- including the ancient Persians,Greeks,Romans,Kartu(Shota Rustaveli,History of Kartly,Dionysius the Areopagite,Georgian Chronicle(p.242);myriad of modern authors and those of XIX-XX cc.The book is clearly addressed to modern young ethnic Armenians and teach them that they are entitled not only to what was made the Republic of Armenia in 1918(itself an abuse of the human rights of another-indigeneous nation that has created a kingdom including the territory of that area in much early days),but to the region'greater than the Great Britain'.Still I give to the authors of this book 'excellent', i.e. 5 stars- for excellent misinformation
3	1	Excellent,based in scientific research. It is not a "sexual book" but a well written book about hormones,thinking, acting and why men and women are different
0	1	Animals should NEVER receive negative punishment (physical or mental). Why should you, when the positive reinforcemt methods have poved to work so well and makes your animal obey you out of respect and not out of fear as the negative reinforcement does? The use of negative reinforcemt stems from a lack of true understanding of canine psychology (as it is utterly unnecessary) and a need to be sadistic. As a veterinarian and animal lover, I strongly advise against this book
4	1	Evolutionist 1: Gee...how can we vent our frustration over the truth in this book? Evoultionist 2: You mean....you actually read the book...you're not just panicking blindly??? Evoultionist 1: Well...I didn't read it all...just some quotes on the internet... Evolutionist 2: OK....so...how do we censor these scientists and academics...make sure that noone actually reads these books? I mean...this is a free country...we can't just burn the books or get the the government to conceal the truths in these books from children!!! Evolutionist 1: Well...we're working on that last one... Evolutionist 2: I got it! Why don't we just make fun of the whole lot of anti-evolutionists using straw men and petty sarcasm! Noone will ever see through that as a feeble self-righteous attempt to keep people's heads buried in the sand! After reading OUR pseudo-review, people will HAVE to continue worshipping Naturalist saints and those yet to come that will prove evolution against all the current evidence! Evolutionist 1: You're right! Instead of actually reading the books, we could could spend hours of our own free time writing these false reviews all over the internet! We're prophets of Darwin, Gould, and Dawkins! Evolutionist 2: Wait...won't the intelligent design people just censor us or try to make US look stupid? Evolutionist 1: Oh no...don't worry about that...We control the mass media AND the schools...and, as for making us look stupid? I think we're doing a pretty good job of making ourselves look stupid, don't you??? Evolutionist 2: Uhh....I don't get it
0	1	Books of political position ought be fact ridden. They should move you to the author's point of view, if not the author's conclusions, by marshalling facts first; then an author can supply analysis constrained by supplied facts. Only then should we be given some further speculation, unless moving directly to reasoned conclusions. Mr. Horowitz does none. Instead he starves us for facts. He substitutes instead only editorial cant. I can conclude only that he aspires to persuade no one. The audience is not the inquiring, the undecided or the doubting. For example, he contrasts, on the first page the Iraq war as "so successful in its results.", with the Vietnam conflict as an unsatisfactory result -- renaming in the process what we thought to be a war. Mr. Horowitz insists on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He states explicitly and blanketly that the execution of American power is a bulwark of national security. He insists that American Presidents have been either the toys or the allies of terrorists. I kept waiting for evidence of any kind. He even says the twin towers were destroyed in only minutes, yet were more important than Pearl Harbor. My guess is that WW II was not so cheap or unworthy. Neither were the more than sixty boys from my high school killed in the World Trade Center; at least I can reference Time magazine as the source. Mr Horowitz cheapens their deaths by saying it was the work of Democrats allied with moslems in their struggle with the Neo-conservatives whose birthright is the unfettered use of American soldiers and guards. Mr. Horowitz has plenty of notes of a sort. Many are only self-referential as opposed to supportive from other sources. He quotes the New York Review of Books, but leaves out words he does not like. Oddly he describes 9/11 as putting the Bush administration "on the run". He probably meant something else, but is simply incapable of precision and accuracy in general. I cannot even recommend the book to those who oppose his purposes because they are so incoherently hysterical
4	4	My family of five (kids presently aged 9,7,3 yrs) has been to Walt Disney World before. We love the place and very much look forward to our trips there. However, experience has taught me that a good guide book is STILL a valuable tool when traveling to Disney, and well worth the money for the knowledge and tips you gain. I've bought _The OFFICIAL Guide to WDW_ (not worth the $ in my opinion), Passporter's (also good), Birnbaum's, etc. but this is still the best-- especially if you are in the planning stages of your trip. If you have small kids, I'd recommend getting the smaller, more portable [...
4	4	I enjoyed the book Emergency: True Stories From The Nations ER, since the stories were all based on actual events. There are some that will make you laugh till you cry and there is some that are real heartbreaking.But I rate this book five stars, and would recomend anyone to read it
4	4	I just wanted to say, I'm sorry to those who gave this book a low rating. you really have missed out on some amazing things God can tell you through this book. I have read this book and it changed my life - reminded me of the real order of things and led me to a deeper listening for God's voice. The more you listen the more you will recognize and hear it. I also have 2 other friends who's lives changed after reading this book as well. I'm talking major changes
4	4	This is a very informative book that clears up lots of misconceptions. It explains why the &quot;wellfare state&quot; is still around, even after so many death notices. The analysis shows that there is no net negative cost for comprehensive and universal social programs, and that there are often significant benefits. For those who can read this book without ideological and political blinders, there is much to learn from Peter Lindert's book
1	4	Wells is a wonderful writer, it is true; however, his bigotry and hatred of certain peoples and of religion is very apparent. His political leanings are also too apparent--it is not an unbiased book and may give some the wrong impression of world events. I am currently reading the book updated just after WWII
4	4	Spellbinding takes on new meaning as this tale twist and turns through treacherous waters. Just when you think Grisham can't do it again, he does it anyway
4	4	Astronomers detect a large object entering the Solar system from deep space. At first it is thought to be just another large rock, but scientists soon discover that it is actually a colossal space ship called Rama. A team of scientists blast off from Earth to investigate in a ship called the Endeavor. What follows is a story of exploration, and one of the best conceived hard sci-fi tales ever written. Who built Rama? What is it's purpose? Why did it come to our solar system? The story follows the progress of the astronauts/scientists in the not too distant future as they methodically explore the unknown space ship. Each new discovery brings new surprises as well. This is also a political tale as well as factions on the ship and on Earth have very different ideas about what Rama is, what is represents, and what should be done. This book is, in my opinion, one of the most intelligent and well thought-out hard sci-fi novels ever written. First published in 1973, it remains as fresh as if it were written today. There are several things that I really like about this novel. First, the exploration of Rama by the crew of the Endeavor proceeds in an organized and intelligent manner by men and women who are not superhuman. Discoveries are assimilated, risks are weighed, and the plan evolves. One common problem with this sub-genre of sci-fi (particularly when transfered to TV) is that individuals of superhuman stature (e.g. the main character has a Ph.D. in astrophysics, was in the Special Forces, a fighter pilot, and in their spare time a classically trained French chef, a lyric poet, and fluent in ten languages) go off on their own to make brilliant discoveries while narrowly avoiding death. This may add drama to the plot, but this cheapens the story and moves the entire story from believable to fantastic. The characters, while perhaps representing some of the best and brightest of humanity, are not absurdly talented beyond reason. Second, Rama itself is fascinating. Clarke constructed a rich world for his intrepid adventures to explore. Finally, there is a sense of wonder or awe associated with the exploration of Rama that many have tried to duplicate, but none have even come remotely close to succeeding. This book has `atmosphere'. Early in the novel Clarke analogizes the exploration of Rama with the opening of Tutankhamen's tomb. There is something wonderful and mysterious about Rama that goes far beyond current human understanding, but understandable by humans nonetheless by scientific analysis and reflection. It is this last aspect that really makes this novel better than 2001. In the latter novel, the aliens are so advanced that they are utterly incomprehensible. In Rama, the alien technology can be understood by homo sapiens. If I had any complaint at all, the novel is a bit short by modern standards. It really seems light at about 240 pages, and it would have been nice if Clarke had further developed several of the story lines. In any case, this is a book that can be read over and over again. There are VERY few books that I read a second time, but this has been one of them. In the end, there are more questions than answers, and many of the questions are not resolved. I have not read any of the sequels because I heard they are really bad and I don't want to spoil this novel. This is one of the novels that put Clarke into the great three of sci-fi (with Heinlein and Asimov), and it won both the Hugo and the Nebula award. This novel really defines and/or sets the standard for the sci-fi sub-genre of exploration/interstellar archaeology
4	4	THE CRANKY DAY is made up of three stories: Cranky Bugs, Put-Upon Percy, and Lady Hatt's Birthday Party. This inexpensive paperback is perfect for the Thomas fan. It has the colorful photographic "illustrations" that look like the series we're familiar with. This one is REALLY popular with my Thomas fans, and you can read the stories one at a time or all three at once. But beware -- when you're finished they're going to want you to read it again! and again! and again
0	1	This book is totally useless. I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail. This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any &quot;free&quot; money anywhere. Keep the money you have
4	4	The best work by Twain I've read to date. This combination history, memoir, travelogue, and collection of sketches is both humorous and entertaining. I have also learned a great deal about Twain, his time, and the history of steamboating and the Mississippi. Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended
1	1	Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!! I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book
4	1	Too Old for This, Too young for That is an amusing,clear,and acurate survival guide to Middle School years
4	4	This is compulsory reading for anyone who has been touched by breast cancer. It provides a perspective that supports patient, family and friends. It transcends medical application and bridges generations
1	1	The premise here is so engaging that I'm not surprised the author got it published, but basically, it's such a self-indulgent ramble that it's not worth the time of people other than the author. How can a person make the topic of James Bond and his 'disturbing world' feel so draggy that it takes real commitment to keep reading through the first 100 pages? If you'd like to know, read the first hundred pages of this book. Like many, I came to this book expecting very little except that it be consistently interesting and fun to read. We're talking about James Bond here after all. The author repeatedly reminds us not to take his pontifications overly seriously, and that's fine, but in that case, we shouldn't have to be bored. I would strongly recommend not reading this book. It could have been covered in a long magazine article or, as I said, as the occasional comment on a blog about James Bond
0	4	When I was a university student 14 years ago, I followed this book to the letter - 3 days in the gym every week for six months and then a split system which got me in the gym 4 days a week for another year or so. In hindsight, it worked (as any beginner gets a little bigger anyway just by heading to the gym) but I picked up a copy of BRAWN a year later - training twice a week just focussing on the big exercises and realised far better results. This book is good for motivation, a trip down memory lane for some; it has some good ideas but generally the routines aren't suitable for anyone training without steroids. I wonder why Joe Weider never discussed the issue when obviously so many, if not all contributors, depended on steriods to realize their success...
4	4	Cortazar was one of the more unearthly literary geniuses of the 20th century; like Borges and Nabokov I return to his short stories often (more than a decade after first discovering them), and can still get new things out of them. I agree with previous reviewers - Cortazar's precision with language rivals Nabokov, Kafka, Proust or Borges. I would add another comparison as well - though the intent is quite different, the very musical and rhythmic sensuality of the writing also recalls the best of Ferlinghetti - Cortazar is confident enough in his expertise to be willing to play with language in a similar fashion, and creates extraordinary and unforgettable worlds throught this (and other) collections. This is a great introduction to Cortazar, with many personal favorites: "Night Face Up," "Idol Of The Cyclades," "House Taken Over" and "Axolotl" are all unforgettable short fictions. I wouldn't stop there - Cortazar's other writing is well worth investigating (especially the second story collection, ALL FIRES THE FIRE). Cortazar seems to be sliding into unfortunate obscurity as of late, with a number of key works currently out of print. Thankfully, and for the time being, this is not one of them. -David Alsto
1	1	Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics. However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments. The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture. This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters
0	1	This book is very hard to read. Excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text. I am going to finish it as an exercise in tenacity
4	4	I can't think of a single REAL JAZZ MUSICIAN who has not read this book...if not they are reading it PRESENTLY!!!!!!! It is the ultimate reference guide. When the Jazz community lost Mr. Feather we lost an invaluable friend and supporter of the artform we affectionately refer to as JAZZ
4	4	Junie B. Jones books are a real blast to read! I purchased this series for my friends daughter and she just loves the book. She wants to collect all the books in the serie
1	1	The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor. That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on
4	4	If one hears the name Sandburg, the first thing to come to mind is probably &quot;Fog&quot; or &quot;City of Big Shoulders.&quot; But in reading this wonderful memoir, we are reminded of what a fine prose writer the man was. The tale of his struggling Swedish immigrant parents finding their way in late nineteenth century America and young &quot;Charley&quot; as he liked to be called, as the name Carl marked him as a foreigner, is a fascinating glimpse of a bygone time and place. The interesting jobs that young Carl took on, such as traveling the back roads selling stereo-optican views, and his conversations with a civil war vet are rewarding and insightful. I believe this is a wonderful read for anyone with a love of biography, history, or simply good storytelling
3	4	"The Killing Sky" is the fifth book in Robert Gandt's great series of novels about Brick Maxwell, and it's one of the two best. (My other favorite is "Acts of Vengeance", the second book in the series.) Brick Maxwell is a U.S. Navy pilot and squadron leader, flying an F/A-18 Super Hornet off the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan, stationed in the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea. The story starts with a joint exercise with the Israeli Air Force ending with an American F/A-18 getting shot down for real! What went wrong? Did the Israeli pilot really push the missile launch button instead of just announcing a simulated kill? And why does the female Israeli Mossad agent make a play for Brick Maxwell? Is she trying to get information out of him or does she have other motives? This book contains the same three general plot elements as most of Robert Gandt's novels: - exciting "you're sitting in the cockpit" descriptions of modern Navy flight operations, with dogfights, carrier-based landings and takeoffs, and push-button warfare with modern smart bombs and missiles. - geopolitical machinations, this time involving high-level Americans and Israelis and Palestinians. And to keep the excitement up there are internal conflicts within each national group, including a really nasty American political envoy with presidential ambitions. - romantic involvement for Brick, this time involving not just one but two women. I liked this book a lot, despite the rather slow start. The suspense gets cranked up by the under-handed dealings going on between the politicians and the resulting armed conflicts between the Palestinians, the Israelis and the American forces. Is the United States really going to invade Palestine and engineer a democratic process, just like in Iraq? And who is really behind the decisions that are causing the continued escalation of hostilities? One of my criticisms of Robert Gandt's novels is that the characters don't really come across as real people. This is still true in "The Killing Sky", but less so than in the first books in the series, another plus for this book. Recommended for all fans of military action novels, as is the whole Brick Maxwell series. Rennie Peterse
0	4	This book will be a great disappointment to many stroke survivors and their relatives, as it was to me, a survivor. It tells the story of one man in England, with moments that make you think there is a similarity, only to be disappointed. The only hope for the book is the wife's diary, and her feelings from the event through the treatment. But even then there is the feeling that her diary in censored, knowing that it would be published. The author does direct the reader to some other good books, and gives us a happy ending. The book does teach us that life goes on, even if you have a stroke, but stroke suvivors already know that fact
0	1	I had a 3 day detention to serve, 90 min's after each school day, so I went to the library originally looking for a book on engenering. I saw this instead, and decided to rent it out. When I got in the car, I noticed the table of content's had several racial comment's in the front, but I ignored it. After reading a few CH. I couldnt beleive this book, but I kept reading it, cause it was entertaining how much of an idiot Chuck D is. He is the reason some white people have negative veiw's of black people. Because he play's the role of a loser who blaims everything on the same people that put him where he is now. Why not just bite the hand that feed's you? If you are in the black Panther's, are obsessed with Chuck D, or just straight up hate white people I would suggest this book. The real reason I hate this book is I despise anyone who makes racist comment's against anyone at any time, and against any race. I myself am white, and there was 3 race riot's where I grew up, I got stabbed in 5th grade by a black kid my age, and my father was murdered before I was born by a black man... So why don't I just write a book against " My oppressor's ". This book show's that Chuck D is truely not a smart man, just a racist fool, who is no more smart then Flavor Flav. He need's to go back to first grade, and watch more barney, so he can learn to love everyone. But I guess he is just going to get his, ironically like his song " Your gonna get your's ". I can not express in word's how much I hate this book, and I feel ashamed for every buying It takes a nation..
1	4	This is a very readable mystery with several cute twists. If you live in or near the central coast of California you will love the way she works in many points of interest. The story is filled with love of man-woman, mankind and dog. You'll love it
4	4	Year after year I wonder how Koontz can continue to keep his writing fresh and entertaining. I worry that he will become like many other authors and become predictable and boring. Happily- this has NOT happened to Koontz. His last several books have only gotten better for me, I have a hard time putting them down! Life Expectancy starts off with a very interesting premise: Jimmy Tock's grandfather made a prediction on his deathbed the same day Jimmy was born, listing 5 terrible days in Jimmys future. Thus, the book begins and we are along for the ride to see what each of these 5 days hold in store for him and his family. Because the characters in this book are so enjoyable and loveable (as most of Koontz's characters are!) I found myself in anticipation really hoping that these days wouldn't destroy them... Other stand out features of this book: Not predictable at all- from start to finish. The ending was especially great in proving this point, as well as just great in general! It was pretty fast-paced and kept the pages turning and did not leave me bored for a chapter. The uniqueness of the story as well as the quirkiness. Lastly, to reiterate, the characters!! Koontz really goes above and beyond most authors I read (and I read A LOT) in creating not only fun, unique and loveable characters- but they are also very memorable! It's not often I can remember characters from a book in much detail, but Koontz has such a gift that I can recall many, many of his characters and always find myself sad when their story ends. I think that is the sign of an exceptional writer
4	3	I mention that this is a board book because so many parents seem dissapointed by how few pages it contains. Your kids will still love it
1	1	The concept of whole language when implemented in California in the 80s was a total debacle and I see that there are still books out there promoting the &quot;whole&quot; concept, only this time it is in math. Use this book only in addition to tried and proven ways of teaching math
4	4	To see the workings of a crisis, minute by minute, day by day from the inside, is incredible. I have renewed respect for Kennedy and all those who averted disaster. Maybe someday they'll release the Krushchev Tapes and we'll be able to see both antagonists
4	4	Mention the word "sadism" and the results it produces will vary from an embarrassed Victorian blush to righteous indignation that such things should exist at all, not to mention it being a topic for discussion among proper and civilized human beings. Yet to Thomas Moore, a former monk and Jungian analyst and writer, it is precisely this topic that needs to be explored mentally, even spiritually, in order to prevent it from erupting into anti-social, or even criminal acts in the flesh. Examining the writings of the infamous Marquis de Sade, Moore delves into the healing role of de Sade that digs deeper than the surface appearance of de Sade as pornographer to find value in what is cursorily dismissed as naught but tasteless perversion. According to Moore's analysis of de Sade's writing, the virgin needs the libertine to complement her chastity, as much as he needs her pristine purity to define who he is. Yet, a deeper understanding of Moore's treatise on de Sade reveals that wholeness is the object of the soul's journey, and that experiencing the self as holy--at the expense of being whole-- unjustly deprives the psyche of its completion. He believes that every human being should be in touch with his Sadean side-- at least mentally-- for human potential not explored is what cripples the soul. Just as there is no stick that has but one end, human potential and creativity must at least acknowledge, without necessarily favoring, the dark side of the psyche so that it's full complexity can be known and appreciated. For Moore, as well as for de Sade, the perverse side of the personna that is forbidden to manifest itself mentally becomes the powerful driving force for enactment in the psycho-socially mal-adjusted person. It is perhaps society's denial of our own dark eros that enrages and offends most when we see it demonstrated in others, for that denial surely perverts any attempt at self-knowledge, and forces the soul to assume a posture of balance and completeness that is false,lame, and ultimately unhealthy. Moore hints that without personal aknowledgment of the darker depths of our psyches, as de Sade so blatantly illuminates, we cannot hope to soar to our greatest heights, for what we resist persists, and the chains of denial keep us tethered to terra firma instead of flying the limitless skies of our Divinity. This book is not a quick read, nor is it for the judgmental or faint of heart. It requires time, and a certain willingness examine our own depths, not favoring the dark, forbidden aspects of our psyche, but rather admitting that a Sadean dark eros lies hale and hearty within us all, waiting to be revealed to honest introspection for spiritual growth through courage of heart.
0	4	Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country. For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be
4	1	I am one of those freaks who would look at a bezillion books before settling with one. (Talking about computer books ofcourse!). This is especially significant when it comes to XML because there is so much tech jargon out there & it is really hard find a book that does not get lost in the details & instead introduce us to the core right away. This book does exactly that. You will start writing decent xml right away. The following will be helpful. 1. HTML knowledge (a little) 2. The concept of scripts 3. The concept of CSS 4. The concept of XML When I say 'the concept of', I am only talking about a surface level, "Purpose of existence" kind. Even if you don't know anything about XML, you will be fine with this book. The book gradually introduces the concepts & does a very neat job of explaining new ideas. Peace.
1	1	This book was neither bad nor good and therefore leaves me with little inspiration to write a review. What must be said is that this book had great potential, which was never fully developed. The idea was good. Even some characters were good. Well, actually just Patrick. And come to think of it, I ended up liking Muffin (the cat) more than I did any of the other Mulvaneys. Though even as a cat lover, I got sick of hearing about Muffin and the other animals which were way too many in the first place. The book did go on and on, too much description about the ordinary (and, oh so cliche at times!).I didn't like the way it jumped between 3rd person and 1st person narrative. I didn't find it confusing, I just found it awkward. It didn't give the chance to really get inside Judd's head (I mean, it was "his" story after all). I couldn't love or hate anyone in the book. It was hard to tell what their motives were and "who" the real person was inside them. They seemed so in-and-out of character. Maybe that was the author's way of exposing them as phonies? I'm not sure. But without love or hate, there's really nothing left to feel as a reader. Left to chose between a ditzy mother, a jerk-of-a-father (but not a jerk enough to hate him or care about what happens to him), an eldest son who is like a prop in this book, a brainiac son who gets revenge only to disappear and become someone completely different without warning or reason, a victimized daughter, that you can't really feel all that sorry for, the youngest son (also a prop), I'm not sure who to root for (if anyone). The worst part was, just when I started warming up to the book (forgiving its flaws, hoping for a great ending), I was hugely let down. It took me about a week to finish the last 2 chapters because the end of the book just dragged and I found myself too tired to pick it up. We are told in a quick (but ironically again, long and tedious) after-the-fact fashion about what has become of Marianne and then in the Epilogue everything is "wrapped up" quickly and neatly with no realism whatsoever. I feel if you're going to resolve things in the end, then RESOLVE them---Tell us what it is and how it came to be without just glossing over everything. The book was long enough; some pages should have been assigned to the ending instead of all the fluff in between. This is a book that should make you cry, but I felt nothing (and I am one of the biggest crybabies ever). If you want a good book about family and family secrets, read Ann-Marie MacDonald's "Fall On Your Knees" or "The Way the Crow Flies" instead. Both excellent books.
4	4	Got a great book the other day called The Medici Effect: What Elephants & Epidemics Can Teach Us About Innovation by Frans Johansson. It about what happens when you step into that area called The Intersection... Contents: Part 1 - The Intersection: The Intersection - Your Best Chance To Innovate; The Rise of Intersections Part 2 - Creating the Medici Effect: Break Down the Barriers Between Fields; How to Make the Barriers Fall; Randomly Combine Concepts; How to Find the Combinations; Ignite an Explosion of Ideas; How to Capture the Explosion Part 3 - Making Intersectional Ideas Happen: Execute Past Your Failures; How to Succeed in the Face of Failure; Break Out of Your Network; How to Leave the Network Behind; Take Risks and Overcome Fear; How to Adopt a Balanced View of Risk; Step into the Intersection Notes; Index; About the Author The Medici Effect is all about the intersection of ideas, cultures, disciplines, and strategies in new and previously unexplored ways. The term comes from the Medici family in Florence Italy in the 15th century. A convergence of thinkers and doers all converged on Florence, which became ground zero for the Renaissance period. New concepts thrived in that environment where people were learning and listening to each other, breaking out of their own fields to combine ideas into revolutionary new areas of study. Johansson asserts (and correctly so, in my opinion) that innovation thrives in these "intersections" that are missed by many, but offer the best chance for breaking away from the "same old thing". The book is extremely practical, in that all the chapters are driven by real-life examples of these intersectional thinkers. You'll see how Richard Garfield combined the idea of collectables and gaming to come up with the mega-hit card game Magic: The Gathering. The singer Shakira takes musical styles from widely different cultures and combines them into a sound that is all her own (and very popular to boot). Eric Bonabeau studied the activities of ants searching for food and applied the observations to network routing and scheduling. These and many other examples show how being a generalist (or at least open to other fields) can lead to connections not possible for highly specialized thinkers. Johansson lays out steps you can take to place yourself in that constant flow of ideas, so that you can start seeing new possibilities in rather mundane unrelated things. I was very impressed with this book, and have already started to look at events and ideas in a different light. I'd recommend this read for anyone looking to spur their creativity beyond the norm...
4	4	This book has been very helpful. It is easy to read, it is easy to look things up in and provides a nice section on treatments of different disorders as well as describing the disorder
1	1	If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through. The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way
0	4	Highly disappointing. No substance. It was a book filled with references to other books. Wish I had bought one of those instead!!!
3	1	Wayne Grudem has written a great deal about biblical manhood and womanhood. Besides articles in periodicals, he has written Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood: A Response to Evangelical Feminism which he co-authored with John Piper. He has written Evangelical Feminism and Biblical Truth: An Analysis of More Than 100 Disputed Questions and then two collections of essays he edited, Biblical Foundations for Manhood and Womanhood and Pastoral Leadership for Manhood and Womanhood. The latest addition to this list is Evangelical Feminism: A New Path to Liberalism?. Grudem describes this book as "an expression of deep concern about a widespread undermining of the authority of Scripture in the arguments that are frequently used to support feminism. It is also a way of posing a question: can a movement that espouses this many ways of undermining the authority of Scripture possible be right?" The book's argument, then, is that evangelical feminism sets those who affirm it on a slippery slope that will inevitably lead to liberalism. It is important to define terms and Grudem, always a deliberate author, does just this. By theological liberalism he refers to "a system of thinking that denies the complete truthfulness of the Bible as the Word of God and denies the unique and absolute authority of the Bible in our lives." And by evangelical feminism he means "a movement that claims there are no unique leadership roles for men in marriage or in the church." Leadership in both the home and the church is to be shared equally between men and women according to their gifts and desires. He leads readers through five points: 1. Liberal Protestant denominations pioneered evangelical feminism and now evangelical feminists have adopted many of the arguments earlier used by theological liberals to advocate women's ordination and to reject male headship in marriage. 2. Many prominent evangelical feminist writers advocate positions that either deny or undermine the authority of the Bible. Other egalitarians endorse books written by these people without taking a stance against those who deny Scripture's authority. 3. Recent trends show that evangelical feminists are heading towards the denial of anything uniquely masculine and some now even refer to God as "our Mother in heaven." 4. The history of others who have adopted these positions shows that the next step is the acceptance of homosexuality. 5. The common thread running through these trends is a rejection of the authority of Scripture in people's lives--the very bedrock principle of theological liberalism. These dire predictions aside, Grudem is careful to affirm that there are some egalitarians who continue to uphold the authority of Scripture (men like Roger Nicole, Walter Kaiser, Jack Hayford, etc) but warns that, while these men may remain orthodox, those who follow them will likely drift further and further from affirming the authority of Scripture, for this is a common pattern in the church. These men, despite their good intentions and their love for the Bible, may be inadvertently leading the next generation astray. Grudem provides a short chapter liberalism and women's ordination, showing that there is no theologically liberal denomination or seminary in the United States today that opposes women's ordination. This proves that liberalism and the approval of women's ordination go hand in hand. The heart of the book is contained in two sections. The first, with fifteen short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that undermine or deny the authority of Scripture. These range from saying that Paul's teaching on women's roles was just plain wrong, to suggesting that women may preach or teach men as long as they are under the authority of a pastor, to relying on experience as the arbiter of what is right and true. The second section, with ten short chapters, examines evangelical feminist views that are based on untruthful or unsubstantiated claims. These include those who teach that Paul told the women in Corinth to "keep silent" because they were disrupted church services, that the word "head" actually means "source," and that the Son is not subordinate to the Father in the Trinity. Grudem concludes "I cannot say for sure. But I can think of no other viewpoint or movement within the whole history of the Christian church (except theological liberalism itself) that has generated so many novel and ultimately incorrect ways of interpreting the Bible." Having provided the facts and having provided brief analysis, Grudem finally seeks to understand where evangelical feminism is taking the church. He concludes that the next step is to deny anything distinctly masculine. At the foundation of evangelical feminism, he feels, is a dislike of manhood itself. This will lead to a denial that there is anything uniquely masculine about God and allow people to refer to God as Mother. The danger here, of course, is that calling God "Mother" "is changing God's own description of himself in the Bible. It is calling God by a name that he has not taking for himself. Therefore it is changing the way the Bible teaches us to think of God. It is thus changing our doctrine of God." The final step along this trajectory is the widespread acceptance of homosexuality. Those who advocate the morality of homosexuality within a biblical context are using the very same arguments used by evangelical feminists. Churches that accept the arguments of evangelical feminists will have very little ground to stand on when they attempt (or if they attempt) to uphold the biblical condemnation of homosexuality. What is ultimately at stake in evangelical feminism is the Bible itself. I appreciated Grudem taking his argument to its fullest extent and showing what is truly at stake here. Too often arguments about issues like evangelical feminism can proceed no further than the doctrine itself. I think Grudem has done the church a great service in showing and proving that this discussion is not merely about how particular churches operate. Rather, based on this discussion we can see which churches can remain faithful in the future and which will inevitably drift further and further from the authority of Scripture and thus further and further from God himself. If evangelical feminism is, indeed, a new path to an old problem, Grudem has shown just how seriously we need to take it
4	4	I was given this book recently and have to say it is probably the most inspirational travel book I have seen for many years. As a founder of an adventure travel company (Intrepid Travel) I see many books of this ilk - but this is altogether different and better. The pictures are fantastic and the copy very rreadable. It looks at 40 destinatiions - some mainstream, some off the beaten track. It makes you want to travel
4	1	This is an autobiography that describes How Saadat decided to come to the Knesset in the interests of Egypt and The Middle East. From fighting the British Colonialism, Arab Corruption, to Egyptian Nationalism. A must for those who want to understand the New Middle East after WW2. Also recommend his wifes Book that came out after One of the most Tragic Assasinations in recent History.
3	4	This is a very complete book on all aspects of us plus sized women--clothing, style and fit, accessories, makeup, etc. I highly recommend it if you tend to need occasional assistance in fit and style
4	4	I am very satisfied with the item, and it delived so quckly
4	4	This book covers all the theory and application in an outstanding way without getting too simple or complex. The book is coherent, very well organized, and filled with excellent tables and graphs. Great examples as well. I have nothing negative to say about this text
4	4	This book is a must if you are studying the Bible. Explanations are given of facts, verses, people and places as you go from one Book in your Bible to the next. I found out about it in Bible study class. My Senior Pastor, has a copy he got over 40 yrs ago, and still used. One of the best studying guides you can have in your library
3	4	The most redeeming quality of this title is its readability. Talbott is able to convey all the drama and excitment of life in international politics. That said, this certainly isn't a title which will help you get a complete understanding of India, Pakistan and nuclear weapons. I read this book to supplement required reading for a course on War in South Asia and it greatly helped in terms of reinforcing key events and players. I reccomend this to those who already have a reasonable understanding of the situation in South Asia and want a bit of light reading and would like to see the soap opera aspect of the affair.
1	1	I am a huge fan of the first Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift publication. I loved the book and have made three quilts that were inspired from the patterns found there. This sequel, More Quilts from the Quiltmaker's Gift is inferior on nearly every level. The patterns are not so interesting, and seem more fussy and complex. In addition, in this sequel publication, the patterns are not rated by level of difficulty, which I believe is a detriment. Finally, the actual quality of the book is not good. Within a day of bringing it home from the store, the cover of the book had curled up like a wood shaving! I think the authors would have done well to stick with the same publisher who put out their first effort. About the only good things I can say about the book is that the instructions seem clear and the photos of other color options are helpful
0	1	I have enjoyed Baldacci's work before but this book was simply awful. I couldn't believe any of the characters and the storyline was terrible. I was very surprised to get such stilted writing from Baldacci. You can miss this one in my opinion
4	4	I used this book as a primary preparation tool for the Sun Certified Business Component Developer (SCBCD) exam. Being a beginner in EJB, I found this book to be very friendly. I liked the layout of the book in general and the writing style of the author in particular. Only relevant pieces of code are presented to focus explanation of topic in question. A complete running application may be downloaded from the author's website. The multiple choice questions at the end of every chapter and ALERTs in every chapter made remembering main points easier. Deployment descriptor elements are clarified in considerable detail and they are explained well. Please note that there are errors in this book - some of them are fairly obvious such as using a capital letter as opposed to a small letter (Java versus java) while others are not so obvious but noticeable by experienced java developers. Regardless of its minor faults, I consider this book to be a valuable addition to my library. Normally I would have a cut a star for the errors but because of its content quality, I felt compelled to give 5 stars. I just passed the exam today thanks to this book. I know that I will not hesitate to buy another book from this author. Thanks Mr.Sanghera! I recommend this book highly without any reservations whatsoever
1	1	I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
4	4	In a letter to the Fourth Congress of Soviet Writers Solzhenitsyn writes, "Lierature that is not the breath of contemporary society, that dares not transmit the pains and fears of that society, that does not warn in time against threatening moral and social dangers - such literature does not deserve the name of literature; it is only a fa√ßade." Cancer Ward is no fa√ßade. A truly moving story of life and death, disease and recovery, Cancer Ward is a novel with impact. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and it is they who tell the story. From loyal party member Pavel Nikolayevich to labor camp survivor Oleg Kostoglotov and through all the characters whose lives fit somewhere in between, the virtues and faults of socialism are examined, dissected, and layed out clearly for the reader. While his contemporaries were busy writing safe novels, novels which towed the party line and supported the prescribed views of Stalinism, Solzhenitsyn took a grave risk. He wrote novels which reflected truth. He wrote novels which portrayed the real life trials of the people. And, in the end, he wrote novels which were not published in the nation he so dearly loved. Make no mistake. Alexander Solzhenitsyn was no rebel. He truly loved his country and supported his government. His use of brutally honest literature was meant to strengthen his beloved country. It was Solzhenitsyn's hope that by portraying the weaknesses of his country he might help eliminate some of those problems. Alas, his works were largely ignored due to the unrelenting censorship of the Soviet government. Fortunately for the rest of the world his works were not lost. They found their way out of Russia and onto the stage of World Literature. For this we can all be thankful. Cancer Ward is an enriching novel and a worthy addition to anyone's library. This is not a book you want to pass up
4	4	This book is a masterclass for people wanting to start up, or revolutionise the marketing of, their seminars and workshops. It is jam packed with advice that really works. No padding, no wasted words. Most importantly, readers will learn how to maximise revenue from seminars and eliminate the risks. This book comes with the highest recommendation. I know it works. It has been a major source of inspiration for me when I started my own speaking business. The value of the book far outweighs its costs. Buy now and discover its secrets for yourself. Then apply the time tested principles and watch your business take off.
4	4	I found this to be one of the best Carole Matthews titles that I have read. Carole's books always present such interesting challenges faced by her protagonists when it comes to life and love, and this one is no exception. Set in a small village on the outskirts of suburban England, Carole does an excellent job in capturing what life is like in a small town, with neighbors watching your every move, speculating and spreading rumors that sometimes only have a sliver of truth to them. She even reveals how wrong people can be about what is innocent, and what isn't in a small town through hilarious antics of a housewife turned prostitute. The main character, Rose, is trying very hard to start a new life in a small town, but nobody wants to give her a break because they don't understand what she does as an aromatherapist, and mistakenly think she is a prostitute! As she settles in, she begins to fall in love with a local, who is going through his own relationship troubles. However, she is still torn by the affair that sent her fleeing from London. I couldn't stop reading as Rose tries so desperately to make the right decision, faltering for some time but eventually coming to terms with her feelings after a rather muddy encounter! A definite must for any fan of Carole Matthews, or British chic lit
0	1	While I was reading American Normal, I kept asking myself, why is he writing this book. Someone finally asks the author the same question, and his answer is, &quot;I don't know.&quot; I have a theory. Osborne started out to write a book showing that AS is an imaginary problem coined to put labels on eccentrics. When halfway through the book his research shows him that it's quite a lot more than that, in fact a real syndrome completely different from just &quot;a little eccentricity&quot;, he is lost. He no longer knows why he is writing. He keeps mentioning drugs. There are no drugs in the treatment of AS itself. He keeps metioning psychiatrists. It's a neurological disorder, not a psychiatric disorder. He meets, casually, a few Aspies, and suddenly he's an expert. This book mostly made me angry, as it would anyone who knows someone with AS. He seems often to think the whole this is a joke. After all, he's eccentric, and he doesn't have it... Worst book I've read on autism yet. Pit
4	4	Whether or not astrology can help to predict events, this book gives many examples of how astrology has been used by people throughout a very long history. Although mention is made of a time when common folk, such as those attending the theater, understood astrological portents as a part of everyday life, the book emphasizes how famous and highly-intelligent people made use of astrology for worldwide matters, as well as for practical, personal application such as the time of death (even though some, given the knowledge, tried and failed to change the event). Choosing to elevate the traditional approach over the modern, psychological method is debatable, but the traditional progression in the book from Hitler to Bush is quite chilling. Well worth the read
4	4	I had my copy of Memoirs Found In A Bathtub confiscated by my 9th grade french teacher in 1977. Hey, it was a 30 minute free reading period. I learned of Kafka's influences on this book ,and their shared heritage, years later. Searching for knowledge can be a treachorous endeavor. The authorities and experts can't always be trusted - especially when they no longer have paperwork to bolster their position
1	1	I was disappointed in this book. I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to. I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things. Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well. The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story. There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line. I felt very let down at the end of this audio book
0	1	I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life. I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it. I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible. This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash. I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined.
3	4	This is a very indepth library for an aspiring CCNA. These books are packed full of entry-level Cisco and networking knowledge. However, do not rely on these books alone to pass the CCNA. Be sure to pick up Todd Lammle's CCNA book to prepare you for the test
3	0	You can use this bbok to introduce parallel and perpendicular lines
0	1	I was enjoying the travel parts of the book, despite numerous detours of self-serving/indulgent behavior by Mr. Crichton,until I reached the part where he was in Bangkok. He teams up with a journalist for a night on the town. His journalist friend suggests they go to one of the area's many brothels. Finally, after testing the waters, the journalist excitedly drops his bombshell and suggests a child whorehouse. Crichton doesn't dare to tell his companion what a loathsome creep he is or that he finds the suggestion repulsive and wants nothing more to do with him. Instead,he goes and checks the place out. He gives a description of tarted up six-year-old girls posing provocatively and being kept in line by geriatric prostitutes. Perhaps I'm just a prude but it seems to me that any normal decent young man would find the idea of sex with tots and grannies vile. I didn't expect Crichton to actually put a stop to all of this but he could have perhaps told the sickie to get some professional help or at least told him that kiddie sex wasn't his thing, instead he makes up some whiny complaint about a stomach ache and tells the guy to go ahead without him. This infuriated me and turned my stomach. I threw the book in the trash. I wish publishers had done the same. FYI, there is no zero star option
0	1	Sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but I was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book. Maybe I should have expected such based on the title, but I found it unsettling nonetheless
4	4	It is an awesome book. If you don't believe me and the other reviewers, go to the library and read it to see for yourself. It is definitely worth reading
0	1	A wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. He dropped his past standards on this book. Only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value. An unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized. I agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers: "The story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying." "The first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying." "Far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... Of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback." "Too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous." "...novel seems dark and pointless." "numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air." If you are new to Le Carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work
4	1	Obviously includes all the "A" list sites but everything else. If you get bored, don't blame this book.
4	4	This is the best book that I have read about Hemingway as a man. It doesn't pretend to be (and is not ) a biography. It is an intimate and deligthful portrait of Hemingway the fisherman, the hunter, the womanizer, the drinker, the gambler and all the things that really meant something to him. Were can you get such a descriptive account of the pain and insecurity associated with a writer's creativity? Without this book one cannot size the tragedy of a writer that, in his last years, was conscious of his inability to create great literature, but was condemned to live up to his myth and his character. To those that criticize this book, on grounds of lack of objectivity, one must oppose that this is a book about Papa like the one that he, when Paris was a moveable feast, would have wanted to write about Hemingway.........After all, if Papa lived, he would have explained to all of us that time is precious and that he took Hotchner under his wings, wined and dined and shared intimate thoughs and moments with him, only in order to provide the young lad with good story writing material. And Hotchner has delivered
4	4	Peter Drucker is a subject in and of itself. His insights into the movement of people and their actions are legendary within the business world. This book provides a clear, essential summary of his life work. If you are in business (which is most of us), if you are looking for ideas, or just plain interested in who thought up some of the &quot;common&quot; business maps of the day, chances are you can read this book and find out that they are all linked to Mr. Drucker. This is not your normal biography- there is real substance here
1	3	I have been a fan of Lois Lowry's books for years, and have appreciated some of the other ways she has handled disability before. That is why I had trouble with how she handled it in this book. Much of my family in the era this book is written lived in rural areas, and many were said to be "touched", with the same conditions that cause me, for instance, to be unable to speak or relate to people in the usual way. They were also accepted in their communities a lot more than I have been in modern urban settings, and none were a danger to their communities. I enjoyed reading about similar settings to the ones in my family stories. That is why the ending was so shocking. There is a stereotype of disability that has caused disabled people to be removed from our families for a long time. This one runs that we don't know any better, but have sinister tendencies lurking somewhere in our inability to understand certain things. It makes for a plot device that is accepted by many non-disabled people. Rain Man went to an institution and is supposed to stay there his whole life because he "might hurt the baby", even though there are ways of preventing that kind of thing without taking such drastic measures, and even though that kind of thing is not common among autistic people. The boy in this story does something similar, with similar results. To people unfamiliar with this stereotype, or who believe in it, this plot device may seem powerful, and a way of advancing the sensitivity of the main character who knows that he "didn't mean to do" what he did. To me, it seems like a shortcut. Many people in roughly that era were institutionalized because of widespread prejudices that they would hurt someone, or rape their sisters, or other things that turned out not to be how it usually actually happens. The story, to me, would have been more powerful by far if it had addressed those kind of real problems, rather than using the hackneyed storyline that is easier to write, perhaps, but advances those very same stereotypes. I wonder how many readers of this book will do the same sort of thing as one young mother did when she refused to allow me to board at her house because she had a small child and believed I would hurt him because I am autistic. That is the true danger in "They're dangerous, but they can't help it." I wonder what kind of thing she had heard and read to form a strange opinion like that. The author is a good author, and from the point of view of someone who might well have had the same social status in that era as the boy did, she could have written him, and even handled the issues around this kind of idea, much more responsibly
0	1	I was hoping this book would be a collection of monologues for women from plays that directors might have heard of! It appears they are written by the author and most are not appropriate for a serious audition. Feel like I wasted my money here.
1	4	This book says nothing. He brings you on a journey through nothing that will you unfilled. Don't read it
4	4	George Orwell, writer of such great classics as &quot;No Winston, two plus two is five&quot; and &quot;All animals are equal&quot; truely outdid himself with this book. His essay, &quot;Such, and Such Were the Joys,&quot; is worth the price of the book alone. The descriptions therein, in the vein of 1984, are detailed and vivid to the point where I almost feel as if I remember and understand Orwell's childhood better than my own. In this essay one also catches a glimpse of what made Orwell the writer he was: a poor, pessimistic, sickly lad whose talent could have created it's own entire cannon if he'd lived longer and enjoyed a more work conducive atmosphere. For every reader who breathes to read, this book is an oxygen tank. (like the one they have at the bottom of the slopes in Aspen.
3	4	Why is it so hard for us to give this man the credit he deserves? We've seen the movies and read the books. And yet, every time I see a book by John Grisham in Hangzhou, I think, "I don't have to finish reading it if I don't like it." I think of his value as trade bait, since he's so popular. And yet, I have never put aside a John Grisham book unread. What more does he have to do? Become less popular? The premise on the back cover is simple enough. A homeless guy takes nine lawyers hostage, somebody dies, and one of our lawyers is changed by the experience. You have no idea what an excellent novel can come from such a simple idea. I've read almost everything Grisham has written, and I can remember most of it, and I'd have to put this at the top of the list. He's a master of character, plotting, simplifying the complex, setting, words, and accessibility. The writer should do all the work so the reader doesn't have to. John Grisham, folks. He's the genuine article. Let's say it, okay?
4	4	I laughed out loud while I read this book. I was surprised that it is so slim, yet each story is packed with humor. The reader cannot help but enjoy the Professor's adventures in the crazy academic world of Philology. This is a great book to take with you if you will only have the chance to read in short sips or if you only have time for one more story before bed- just make sure you close the windows so the neighbors don't complain about the laughter
4	4	If you're into programming games for Pocket PC this is the book for you! An incredible resource that integrates the basics into an easily solvable puzzle
3	3	I love this story, I was loving it from page one up until the last comic. I mean here we have a great subtly running plot in Thorpe, Silver, and the deceased Doctor, but then suddenly in the last issue we see none of the three stories resolved. Yes, we are implied strongly that the doctor does away with thorpe, but that isnt good enough, what of Thorpe's Empire, how does Batman find out, and do we ever see the ghost again, maybe we don't, maybe we're better for it. But as for Silver, at least I was sad to see her walk away as yet another Superhero-girlfriend-itis casualty and not have anything more happen along the lines of her life in general, or Batman's general dealing with it. Anyways, at least these were just issues and not an intended mini-series, so all of these qualms are pretty much null and void. As a whole, ITS AN AWESOME STORY
4	4	Finally,, this book was just what I have been looking for. I've been diligently searching for information on how my lesbianism would effect my daughter and the sterile studies I found just didn't seem to satisfy my quest. I found comfort from this book and in knowing who she becomes depends on all the factors of parenting and not just the fact that I'm a lesbian. This collection outweighs the studies because the honesty of the writers provided rare and precious information. I hope volume two is in the works and perhaps we will hear from some more artificial insemination babies. Thanks to the writers and editors for letting these voices be heard loud and proud
1	1	I've been focusing on some prizewinning books as of late, and I thought this would be a necessary prelude to reading Ford's Pulitzer Prize winnning "Independence Day". Ford has insights into what suburban life is and the desire for comfort and mystery in protagonist Frank's life. Frank's struggle to wrestle with the loss of his son and his marriage presents an opportunity to peer inside his mind and see what makes it tick. What you think of this book will depend on what you think of Frank as a narrator. His desire to evade deeper meaning and personal responsibility was maddening to me at times; others will find this a profound truth in the book. I also found him to be longwinded and I had a hard time rooting for and identifying with him as a character. Slogged through this book and at the end, I don't think it was worth it for me. 2 star
1	1	This is a really thin book, and for the price, the production value is terrible. The graphic design, and poor layout, takes a lot away from the information of the book. Page after page, you wonder if this recent publication was from the 1980s. The information was light, and just skimmed over details. There was WAY too much emphasis on Analog. There are other search softwares out there. The case studies were nice, but no real insight was given. Overall - it's an overpriced fluff book. Could be summaried in 5 pages
3	1	For an avid reader like myself, it's often tough to know what to read next. In this book, Nancy Pearl helped me get quite a few suggestions. The book is helpfully broken up into little chapters about different genres or subjects, such as Action Heroines. I found it great, because if I'm not interested in that particular subject, I can just skip to the next section. The only thing that prevented me from giving this book 5 stars was that the summaries about the books are way too short. I really couldn't tell whether I'd like the book or not until I had come and read a few of the book's reviews on Amazon. All in all, this is a marvelous book, chock full of great suggestions for the casual and avid reader. I recommend it wholeheartedly
0	0	This is easily the worst book in the E&E series
3	4	When Michael Nyman first published this work in the 70s, it was the only book of its kind to discuss some of the most cutting-edge stuff going around. Most musical texts avoided discussing the Fluxus group as &quot;music,&quot; but Nyman integrates these radicals easily, and provided the first discussion of the Scratch Orchestra (Cardew et al), and related topics. The book still contains some of the clearest discussions of these topics around. It's great to have it back in print, though too bad Nyman couldn't be bothered to provide updates on some of the folks discussed, like Hugh Skempton
4	4	Around the World in Eighty Days, by Jules Verne, is a novel set in 1872, when technical revolutions allow a man to travel around the world in eighty days. But, to all the members of the Reform Club but one, this is only correct theoretically. However, to Mr. Phileas Fogg, this is a practical number. He then wagers twenty thousand pounds that he can make the journey. So Mr. Fogg and his newly acquired servant, Passepartout, immediately set out for their first stop- Suez. There they encounter a detective named Fix, who has heard news of a robber that fits Mr. Fogg's description exactly. Fix, wanting the reward of five percent of the fifty-five thousand pounds stolen, makes it his business to stop the `criminal' at all costs. Fix, believing that the wager is just a ruse to get the cops off his tail, thinks that Mr. Fogg will not follow through with this journey around the world. All goes smoothly, seeing as Fix is unable to attain a warrant for Mr. Fogg's arrest, until the railway that they are traveling on from Bombay to Calcutta, much to their surprise, is unfinished! Fortunately, thanks to Mr. Fogg's cunning ways, the party is able to buy an elephant to travel the fifty miles to the next railway station. On the way to the next railway station at Allahabad, they see a young woman being carried by Indian savages. An acquaintance, Sir Francis, explains that she is going to be sacrificed. Mr. Fogg, having gained twelve hours, decides to save the woman from a painful death. Aouda, as it turns out, is royalty to a village in India. But, since the savages will stop at nothing to find her, it becomes necessary to take her to her cousin in Hong Kong, which is conveniently one of the stops on Mr. Fogg's journey. But, much to the party's dismay, the relative has moved to Europe. Fix, hoping to delay the party, gets Passepartout knocked out on opium, keeping the valuable information that the Carnatic, the vessel from Hong Kong to Yokohama, is leaving that night instead of tomorrow morning. However, to Aouda's sorrow, the party finds another privately owned boat to take them to Shanghai, leaving Passepartout behind. The party decides to go to Shanghai because that's where the steamer to San Francisco starts, then stops at Yokohama and Nagaski, then departing for San Francisco. Much to the party's delight, they find out that Passepartout actually did make it aboard the Carnatic before it left, and they had a reunion aboard the San Francisco steamer. The steamer makes it into the San Francisco bay on the third of December, and Mr. Fogg has neither gained nor lost a day. The party then takes a rail passage from San Francisco to Ogden, only impeded by a herd of bison for three hours. On the way from Ogden to Omaha, however, a band of Sioux Indians attacks the train. Three passengers are captured, including Passepartout! Mr. Fogg does his duty, and rescues Passepartout. Fix, now having his best interests to get Mr. Fogg back to English soil as soon as possible, tells of a sledge that can be taken to the city of Omaha, where trains are plentiful. They take the trains to New York without stoppage. However, upon arriving at New York, they find out that the China, the steamer going to Liverpool, left only forty-five minutes beforehand! Mr. Fogg's party is able to board a private boat, for two thousand pounds each. He then `persuades' the crew to set sail for Liverpool. A storm makes the crew resort to steam power only. They run out of coal and have to burn the wooden parts of the ship, which Mr. Fogg buys off the owner for sixty thousand dollars. They take a rail line from Queenstown to Liverpool, gaining twelve hours on the steamers. The arrive in Liverpool at noon on the twenty-first, leaving only eight hours and forty-five minutes to get to the Reform Club. But, much to Mr. Fogg's surprise, he is arrested by Fix. But the thief had been caught three days before! After a three-hour delay, they charter a train to London, where they arrive at 8:50-five minutes too late. The next day, Mr. Fogg and Aouda decide to get married. When Passepartout runs off to find a reverend, he learns that it's only the 21st instead of the 22nd! Mr. Fogg arrives at the Reform Club at the preset time, winning his wager! By traveling east, he had gained a day during his journey, allowing him to win his wager. Jules Verne does a great job balancing facts and excitement in this novel. He provides an exciting science-fiction story, while giving some great info on places around the world. I enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone with a sense of adventure, or whoever has dreamed about going around the world
4	4	Dave Barry writes as though he were Elmore Leonard on speed. It is hard to say exactly where the plot loses and contact with reality and possibility, but at the end you have to sit back and laugh and blow a sigh of satisfaction and relief that such things cannot happen, such people cannot actually exist. Quite. Like Leonard, Barry's characters get their motivations, a lot of them, from the draw of the illegal, the desire to make big quickly. They are such strange people, each one perhaps, just, possible, and yet thrown together they interact in ways that could never be real. And Barry keeps the entire thing just teetering on the edge between hysteria and tragedy, leaving his readers poised to fall either way, and laughing the entire time, both from the absurd humour and from relief. I don't know how many other books Barry has since written, novels, i mean, not his humour columns (this was his debut fiction), but i shall have to read them and leave his newspaper offerings alone. They, the columns, aren't even in the same realm, let alone league
4	4	This was the first book I've read by Toni Morrison, and it did not disappoint. The story takes place in Ohio in the early 1940s - before the Civil Rights era, before Martin Luther King, Jr., and before Rosa Parks ever stayed seated on the bus. The story is told mainly from the focus from a young black girl about another young black in the neighborhood. The other black girl, Pecola Breedlove, comes from a family that is poor with a father who is an alcoholic. Pecola is considered ugly and her greatest wish is to have blue eyes, as she firmly believes this will make her beautiful. Naturally, the story involves much more than this, and Toni Morrison weaves a story that catches the reader up from the very first words and doesn't release them until the final page is turned. Ultimately, the idea of self-loathing is plainly seen - not just within Pecola, but within an entire community, an entire race. Pecola's story is not a pleasant read, yet it is difficult not feel a tenderness for this child. She begs to be nurtured. Many people who saw me reading this book told me it was a "black" book, but I disagree. The idea of self-loathing - either within oneself or within a community - is not specific to any one group of people, to my way of thinking. However, Toni Morrison has so captured the feelings and forced the reader to face them, that this book speaks to any and all who opens the pages. No child should be made to feel they are less simply because of who they are. A very moving book, highly recommended.
0	4	Perhaps I didn't read the description closely enough. This book is a historical text, not applicable to today's surveying.
4	4	Recently, I have read a lot of books on Creativity and Innovation. My big surprise is that virtually none of them mention Koestler's The Act of Creation. This is unfortunate because this book is probably the most authoritative examination of creativity. Attention to this classic is worth reviving. Koestler examines three types of creativity - Humor, Science, and Poetry. Humor, according to him, is cruel (a valuable insight). Poetry, and other forms of art, integrate oneself with the World. Science occupies the neutral middle. It is amazing how Koestler manages to link all three kinds of creativity with a common framework. My two biggest take-aways from this book are regarding the process of creation and its form. As Koestler describes beautifully - "..uncovers, selects, re-shuffles, combines, synthesizes already existing facts, ideas, faculties, skills. The more familiar the parts, the more striking the new whole." This is corroborated by all geniuses who have stood `on the shoulder of giants'. Even inventors like Edison fit this framework. This is close to saying that instead of thinking `outside the box', link several boxes to each other. The other great insight is that the final breakthrough is rarely verbal, but in images. So people see new insights in a dream-like trance, rather than expressing it in language. Language, probably, impedes creativity. There are several more delightful and relevant insights on creativity in this masterpiece. Nearly a bible on creativity.
4	4	Outstanding book. I was lucky enough to meet Lyle Bouck. I can honestly say, he is one of the finest men I have ever had a chance to meet. There is no reason this man should not have won the Medal of Honor. A great read, and excellent job on telling the story of these heros
4	4	I think I've now bought 6 copies of this book, for my own library, to lend to people who are interested and might benefit, and to give as empathy gifts to friends and relatives entering Hospice, or their grieving families after a loved one's death. I have Stage IV - advanced, terminal or incurable (take your pick) breast cancer. I've been in treatment, continually adjusting as best as I can to new treatments, new worries and new symptoms, trying to preserve as good a quality of life as possible along the way. Meanwhile, Final Gifts has helped me accept and move towards the idea of quality of death being an important event for me and those I love. Once I give up treatment, or treatment fails me (whichever comes first), I've arranged for a local Hospice organization to help my husband and I cope, at home. Having read Final Gifts, it was easier for me to go ahead with planning my graveside funeral according to my culture and preferences, to hire a local stone cutter to design my headstone together - he has since completed it, other than the date of death, so it will be ready to mark my gravesite a week after I'm buried, and even to write my own obituary (to the extent that I know the information). All this is done, a relief - even a pleasure, to have had a say beforehand, and Final Gifts, which I and then my husband read over a year ago, provided the impetus, and the hope for a death with dignity and beauty
0	1	if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive
0	1	This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative
0	4	This has to be one of the worst ever organic chemistry books ever devised. The author will give a detailed explanation with illustrations and at the very end of the discussion , once you have committed the information to memory, the book will say that it does not happen this way. The author seems to wax poetic, however, he gives no simple list of rules for common nomenclature problems, for example, I defy you to find a list of how to name alkanes under IUPAC rules. All you want is a simple list , for example, 1) find the longest chain of carbons, 2) ......... instead of this you will be exposed to extraneous quotes from plays and movies as well as anecdotes from the authors life. Another complaint is that the book gives several good questions in the text and at the end of the chapter, but NO answers in the back. If you want the answers, you have to purchase the 40.00 solution manual. My condolences to you if your o-chem teacher has been hoodwinked into using this book by the publisher, the only advice I can give is that you purchase the solutions manual, because this gives some very detailed explanations. Good luck, because you will need it
4	4	It's hard to begin to praise Leigh Montville's biography of baseball's greatest slugger ever. There's a prelude written in a 'foggy,' uncertain-of-detail prose style which deals with the young George Herman Ruth's being committed to a 'boy's school,'and then drops into a dead-accurate lowdown which Montville researched diligently, right down to the brothers and young 'Nigger Lips's' discovery of the game and his rapid mastery. Montville tells true stories about The Babe's slugging, eating, drinking and sexual prowess in sometimes drop-deadpan humour, and he's a hell of a sportswriter as well. Three cheers for Montville and the Babe!!! (But hey,who hit a lifetime .371?
4	4	This work is a testiment to Chester Himes' brilliant insight and characterstic of the schitzophrenic relationship most extremely talented black artists have had with America. Much praised for his urban crime series, his more politically charged work was often ignored. This book and the truths it reveals about America's ability and inclination to create entire groups of people with nothing to lose speaks volumes about today's society as it did when written by the author. Many who read this will be afraid, as well they should. You will be entertained none-the-less, and hopefully inspired to think. The ending leaves something to be desired, I suspect that is because Mr. Himes was not alive to complete it himself
0	1	This book is highly overrated. I am sure I will get blown away for saying this but it has nothing to do with my appreciation of modern writing. I enjoy Joyce, and many avant garde writers. Stein has an ego as big as a house. Witness her constant comments about herself as a genius in the Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. The literary equivalent of Picasso she is not. The book is slow and boring, filled with failed, in my opinion, rhetorical tricks. If you want stream of consciousness avant garde writing there are many better writers, Joyce being the best. Jack Kerouac is a newer author who is great also. I found it difficult to finish this book. It did not keep my attention. I basically find all the praise for her as both a writer and an individual vastly out of proportion to her talent. It would be helpful if those writers and academicians who are full of praise for her would perhaps write some articles that are readable saying exactly why she is a genius.
3	4	Famous mathematicians have often emphasized the role of visual intuition; e.g., Hilbert: &quot;Who does not always use along with the double inequality a &gt; b &gt; c the picture of three points following one another on a straight line as the geometrical picture of the idea &quot;between&quot;? Who does not make use of drawings of segments and rectangles enclosed in one another, when it is required to prove with perfect rigor a difficult theorem on the continuity of functions or the existence of points of condensation?&quot; (from his famous address at the 1900 International Congress). This book is a collection of well over 100 one-page proofs, collected from various sources. The topics range from number theory to calculus, and most of them require no advanced mathematics. Typically there is a statement of a result, with a labelled diagram showing how it is &quot;proved&quot;; in some cases there are a few auxiliary equations along with the picture. These are not simple, often requiring quite a bit of thought before the &quot;Aha!&quot; moment. Working through them is a valuable exercise for the student of mathematics--having seen, e.g., six different visual proofs of the Pythagorean theorem, one comes to really *understand* the result, not just &quot;follow the logic&quot;. I have not encountered any better way than this book to &quot;see&quot; how mathematical truth is discovered and proved. It can be valuable as a supplement to courses through precalculus and elementary calculus. Perhaps one of its best uses is to inspire teachers to present results in a more lively way then &quot;definition-theorem-proof&quot; or &quot;just memorize it&quot;
4	4	Nostromo is simultaneously a great political novel and a great psychological novel. A large part of Conrad's achievement is his fusion of these 2 elements into one seamless narrative. Nostromo describes the penetration of a Latin American country by European/North American capitalism and the ensuing revolution. All the characters in Nostromo are engaged in the intensely political acts carrying the plot forward. Conrad based his narrative on a considerable amount of research on contemporary Latin America and the articulation of the plot elements is elegantly realistic and gripping. The psychological elements concern characters' motivations for their acts. A recurrent ironic theme is that important characters are driven to act by motivations that have nothing to do with political objectives or economic gain per se. Unlike most of his other novels which offer a psychological portrait primarily of a single character, Nostromo features several characters whose motivations and actions are explored by Conrad. The focus shifts from character to character is a way that consistently advances the plot, a brilliant piece of formal construction. Finally, Nostromo features some of Conrad's best descriptive writing. Because of the complexity of the plot and characterization, Nostromo is not the easiest of Conrad's novels to read. Nostromo is ultimately well worth the effort expended
4	4	The intimate stories of the cultural changes that represented the 1950s are told by one who was at the center of the storm: Andy Warhol. In his studio, the Factory, he created large canvases of what came to define Pop Art, listened to music which reflected a radical new generation's energy, and remained at the hub of the avant garde. No other book recreates the pop atmosphere of the times - and any reader of 1960s history and culture must have it. Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc
4	4	I had the privilege of spending an afternoon at the Long Island home of Pietro Di Donato many, many years ago when a friend of mine, John Liscio,took me to visit. Mr. Di Donato's father, I was told, died when he fell into a vat of cement back in the days when there were no labor laws to protect workers. The book was shaped from this incidence. Powerful book, and an even more powerful man. Both left an indelible impression
4	4	This book is one of the best I've ever read. I rarely sit for an entire day to read a book but I just couldn't stop reading. Mr. Richardson starts by explaining the culture of the Yali tribe, then moves to the life and background of Stan Dale. Seeing the providence of God at work as the third part brings the Yali tribe and Stan Dale together is remarkable. Stan Dale's conviction, comittment, and compassion is something to inspire any believer concerned with spreading the Gospel of Jesus Christ
4	4	I couldn't put this down, from the first fishing trip that turns into a life-changing trap, to the final decisions two young men--and older men--have to make about their history, their lives and their role in re-living or changing history. Powerful book. Highly recommended
3	1	The brave Anna Politkovskaya reveals the reality of Russia today in this sad, sometimes horrifying book. After a brief window period of freedom under Yeltsin, Russia has rapidly become a vast swamp of corruption, oppression and deception under Putin. Politkovskaya tells of the trouble and suffering of ordinary people who are humiliated and exploited by the criminal nomenklatura. For example Nina Levurda, who in trying to establish the truth about her son's death in the Chechen War, became a victim of this system that when not cruel, is completely indifferent to the individual. This and other cases are discussed in the chapter My Country's Army And Its Mothers. In Russia, people imitate the man at the top, thus Putin is the one who shapes Russian society. It is mainly he who is to blame for the brutality and extremism prevalent in the army and the state apparatus. There are sections dealing with war criminals, brutality against privates in the military, government complicity in crime, the corruption in the judiciary, the struggle to survive in places like Kamchatka, and racism against people with a non-Slavic appearance. Russia's stability is of a monstrous type, where power means everything, few people hold the law in any regard, bribes keep business and the state running, and a free press has almost disappeared. Putin's bureaucrats have taken corruption to new records, unheard of even under Yeltsin or the Communists. As a lieutenant-colonel who never made it to the rank of colonel, he has the mentality of a Soviet secret policeman. The Yukos affair and the imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky demonstrate what a vindictive little man Putin is and how he is steering the country towards fascism. This process of crushing dissent and stifling freedom has been escalating throughout Putin's first presidential term and shows no sign of abating during the second. The Western press has mostly not showed great interest in this slide to oppression in Russia. It is hard not to write Russia off when confronted by the experiences in this book: the deliberate cruelties, the cold indifference and the manipulation of the media. Mercifully there are still people like Politkovskaya and Lev Ponomarev who are brave enough to speak out. This disturbing book concludes with explanatory notes containing references.
4	4	I was quite surprised to see a biography of James Tiptree, Jr. at all, let alone such a magnificent one. Ms. Phillips has done an amazing job at bringing both the woman and the writer into clear focus. I can't imagine that any details of Tiptree/Sheldon's life are not captured here. Certainly a must read for true sci-fi fans and well as those curious about the history of women's role in our society. This bio will win several awards, no doubt about it. Quite simply all you could ask for in one volume
4	4	As an executive coach and facilitator of leadership transformation, I was inspired my the author's personal journey of growth and transformation. The feel was authentic, and reflected a deep committment to fulfilling a higher purpose. I personally found many answers to problems that perplexed me. It has also been a source of wisdom to support and empower those around me in both formal and informal settings. Looking for a purpose for being? You will find some answers here
4	4	I find this book very easy to read. It is fraught with valuable, profound, substantial insights. It will rapidly acquaintance people who are not yet familar with MBA topics and it will solidify the knowledge of veterans in these issues. So, either way you win. Also, even though this book is intended mainly for service providers (doctors, lawyers), it can be easily extrapolated to any managerial work at whatever stage. Dr Jusuf Hariman, Manuscript Assessor, Fellowship of Australian Writers
0	1	The whole thing was just awful, I don't mind telling you. I don't know why anyone would buy the book for the recipes to start with when there are so many "meals in 30 minutes" internet sites...all completely nutritional with different caloric contents. Then there's the advice...it was just as bad, I found. Well, bad in the sense that it was silly. Really quite silly. I must admit that I must agree with the reviewer that said if you are eating an entire plate of French Fries, or Freedom Fries, depending, and you don't know that you are eating something that is going to put some pounds on, then reading this book isn't going to help you. It does kind of sound like the positive reviews are all written by people that know the author personally. Sounds a little bit like the Pentagon's planted news stories in Iraq if you don't mind my saying
3	4	This is a fascinating book! Kurin gives a color and life to the history of the Hope Diamond, showing the interesting characters and lives touched by the "curse" and also those lives that have been positively affected by the diamond. There are photos, paintings, illustrations, and cartoons interspersed in the text to help bring alive the history of the gem. The writing was smooth and accessible and I truly enjoyed the look into history and past cultures as the author brought us on a world and historical tour of the Hope Diamond
1	3	This book is really geared toward women who are into feminism. All the quotes in the book are from women in her groups. If you're not into the female-identity world, pick another book
0	1	It seems that people either love it or hate it and I belong to the latter category. How did this become a classic??? Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage
0	4	I really did love his collaboration with Deepak on Living Beyond Miracles, but I am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. If you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, Deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. I get really tired of hearing Wayne regurgitate other people's work. It is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work. And when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on Maui, I was actually a little bit offended in that I felt sorry for the audience. (I saw this on PBS) At first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. I have heard him do this in every single audio work I have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from. I know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. Too bad! Without it, he could change so many more people's lives
4	4	For an student or practitioner of adverstising and marketing, this is a "must read" and a personal library staple. Yes, the examples may be dated, but the concepts are still operable. You should read their "Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind" first. Though based on Von Clauswitz (set piece warfare), there is much to be learned. Include Sun Tzu The Art of War in your library as well. Not that I have an opinion
0	4	If a reader were to believe the many ludicrous claims that Adams makes about Thomas Eakins, one would think that the artist was homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, and a pedophile, exhibitionist, voyeur, sadist, and masochist; and further, that he practiced incest and bestiality (all of which, Adams suggests, was driven by a desire to posses his own mother). Take your pick! Adams covers all the bases. Eakins is not so much "revealed" in this book as he is "concealed." He seems to ignore altogether, what to my mind, are the most fascinating things about this remarkable man: that he studied logarithms for fun, that science, not art, was his first love, that he was conversant in five languages, and that he found beauty where others saw ugliness. Among the more humorous assertions that Adams makes about Eakins is that the artist painted while sitting on the floor (he used an easel), that he shot his sister's cat for fun (Adams conveniently leaves out the fact that Eakins' father ordered him to do so because the animal was rabid), and that he painted clergymen because they wore dresses, which supposedly reminded Eakins of outfits his dead mother wore. After reading this dreadful book I came to actually like it as a study of how inbred (dare I say incestuous?) that some members of our academic community have become. Even if you are convinced, or want to believe that Abraham Lincoln was homosexual, you will still have difficulty making the creative leaps necessary to take this book seriously
4	4	Watching Fred over the years has brought me alot of respect for the game. This book brings me more respect for him as a person. We all wonder what it takes to be a superstar, this book details that very thing. I am proud to see a writer who can step inside and describe a person like kathlene bissle did. Fred touches so many people in our precious game of golf. We Fred thank you and your author for allowing us to step inside of your life an explore
4	4	I, like most of my women friends I've talked to, including my mother and my sisters, shape memories and moments based on the clothes we were wearing at the time. I bought this book in 1995 when it was first published and have referred to it several times over the years for inspiration and support. I found it in the "Self-Help" section of the bookstore. This little book does as good a job as anything I've read, at getting in a woman's head. Clothes are how we remember. Wearing our favorite clothes or shoes or carrying our favorite handbag gives us confidence and helps us cope. For a while, I kept a diary of drawings of outfits whenever I'd want to remember an important event. Ask me what I was wearing when I held my niece for the first time (navy blue A-line Liz Claiborne dress) or when I went to my first job interview out of college (a polka-dot suit I called The Stewardess) or the night I was first kissed by the love of my life (a shirt that said "Keep On Truckin" in glitter... heh). A good friend's mother passed away a few months ago, and I bought a copy for her, since Ms. Beckerman mentions the death of her own mother. She also mentions marriages, divorces, babies, and career successes, and most importantly, what she wore. It makes a great gift for any woman. Or for yourself
0	1	Okay, maybe I am greatly missing something, and someone can inform me of where they are, but I couldn't find most the guys sources. There were numbers beside certain facts, but I looked into the back of the book, and everything, and found NO connection with the numbers listing where the fact originated. I went to the index, and what was listed as recources, but they had NO connection with the numbers which were listed besides the facts in which he put forth. When I read a book which is suppose to expose new information to me, I would expect there to be an extensive list of sources so that I can look up the information and the people in which he obtained the information from. What I found in the resources section were links to papers I should read which all contain biased info which were mainly on why you should eat Vegan. I don't deny that the guy truly believes what he is doing is right, and that he is truly trying to help people, but the fact that I can't find sources bothers me. Anyways, this guy talks about how great it will be to live long -- personally, I could give a crap....last thing I want to be is freaking 50yrs old, but that is just my opinion. I don't get what the point of him writing numbers beside facts was if he isn't going to back those numbers up with source information. Read at your own risk. There is always the chance that I obtained a copy which left out this information, or that I am just missing it, but until I see a source list on his information, and am able to see completely the studies he includes, which talk about people living longer, being healthier, etc, then I can't fully believe him
1	1	You guessed it. I'm a cracka from England that has no idea or grasp on African American life; therefore I'm really not qualified to give a justifiable review of this book. I just figured I would chime in like all racist Saltines do. Sorry
3	4	Not the best Anne book, but good! :-) It's 'good' to see some conflict in Anne and Gilbert's marriage instead of the sweet but forced bliss in ANNE OF WINDY POPLARS and ANNE'S HOUSE OF DREAMS
4	1	Professor Eagleton takes no prisoners in this thorough albeit short critique on the theories of postmodernism. Focus is placed on postmodernism's general theories in relation to philosophy and political theory as opposed to postmodernism's contribution in the arts and architecture. This, in fact, could well be the subject of an entirely new book, however, aesthetics, in this case, is not Eagleton's main concern. It probably should be stressed that a general knowledge of philosophy, postmodern theory and political science would be advantageous before cracking this text, however, someone with only a slight awareness of these subjects could push through the book (dictionary in hand) without too much difficulty. By definition, post modernism is hard to define, as it claims no foundational tenets: it is more a method or perspective against established ideas in philosophy. As Eagleton writes, "It is animated by the critical spirit, and rarely brings to bear upon its own propositions." (P.26) From a socio-political standpoint, postmodern theories are part of a culture of "unmaking". It can be characterized as a rejection of all "metanarratives" or "grandnarratives"; a protest of modernisms inclusion into the established order of the `canon', a snubbing of intellectual elites, a blurring between high and low art, where Bart Simpson sits comfortably with Shakespeare. I would characterize it as a cynical "anti" position on just about any idea that claims validity or application in society. The key principles of all postmodern theories include: "...decreation, disintergration, deconstruction, decentrement, displacement, difference, discontinuity, disappearance, demoralization and delegitimation." (Post Modern Theory, Best, Kellner, 1991) In one respect, Eagleton applauds postmodernism's huge body of work over a short time, and its stubborn demystification of natural institutions and conventions, though, criticises its blatant lack of self-criticism and ability to offer any alternatives after its deconstruction of all other theories. There is a certain feeling of excitement and freedom after reading such postmodern luminaries as Derrida, Lyotard or Kristiva, but after wading through their dense and at times "cult-like" prose, one is left with the feeling of utter nihilism, realising that these theories are empty rhetoric, that over three thousand years of human progress was all a lie, a "grand-narrative" to keep us chained. For the most part Eagleton criticises postmodern theory against the theories of Marxism and socialism, and does a remarkable job revealing postmodernism's na?ve, almost adolescent view of the present world situation. He concludes that postmodern end-of-history thinking gives us no future other than the present. That there are many possible futures, including fascism: how would postmodern theory shape to such a future? In my opinion, not too well. This book is a valid discussion and a persuasive argument on the many pitfalls of postmodern theory.
4	4	My five-year-old son loves this book. The first time, I read it out loud to him and his sister. He has read it alone several times since then. I think the writing is right on his level - he has tackled tougher books but not gone back to them like this one - and it is long enough that he doesn't finish it in fifteen minutes. The story sounds to me just like something a kid would think of - for example, how Elmer crossed the river full of crocodiles. I also asked my son what he liked about it, and he said, "Dragons." He might have given a longer answer if he hadn't been busy reading the book at the time
4	4	I couldn't put it down. I think it really sets the reader up with a better understanding of Iran in the 20th century, and how things have gotten so out of hand there now 26 years after the ordeal ended
4	1	If you wanted to write a game for a PocketPC device this would absolutly be your book. However, I've been writing utility applications I find myself using this book over other references. This is the best lightweight WinCE/PocketPC progamming book out there- games or not. Harbour covers topics in a very easy-to-understand way- from graphics and sound to networking. No matter what the issue I usually go to this book first, then then web, then one of the other WinCE books I own if need be. If you're new to WinCE (esp. coming from a non Win32 background) this book is exceptionally great
0	1	This is one of the worst (maybe the worst) books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing. The author and the publisher are insulting the intelligence of readers by publishing such a stupid book. The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is "How Technical Analysis Works" by Bruce Kamich. Husam Abu-Haimed, Ph.D.

3	4	I've just reread "The Cat Who Smelled a Rat." In it, Jim Qwilleran is still in fine mettle. This mystery, No. 23 in the "Cat Who" series, is the last one most fans will enjoy. In this book, Qwill still remembers small details from previous novels. He's still interested in the mysteries around him, and he does some active snooping around. He's still a bit of the Lothario despite himself. And he still has faith in Koko's awesome powers. Starting with the next book, the mystery gets solved almost by accident. Qwill becomes a parody of himself, and the novels start to get worse and worse. Eventually, the books begin to get facts wrong and characters begin to act, well, out of character or just inexplicably drop out of sight. (The latter must be hard to do in a small town 400 miles north of anywhere.) Whether Lilian Jackson Braun, now approaching 90, has lost her touch, or whether they're being ghost-written, I leave to you to judge. But the books become just dreadful. I recommend that readers go out on a high note and stop after No. 23. It's been a good run
1	1	I found this book to be dull, pretentious, and without any merit. Growing up in the south must have been difficult, but I fail to see what this memoir has to do with anything other than the author showing off his checkered past and large vocabulary. Yaw
4	4	This book is an excellent way to introduce solids, liquids, and gases. I used it with a 3rd grade class and it was perfect
0	1	Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star
4	3	When I first obtained Partners in Crime by J.A. Jance, I had no idea the story was taking place in Bisbee, in Cochise Co., Arizona, which only added delight to my reading enjoyment. I lived in Sierra Vista which is also in Cochise Co. a few years ago, and I must say the descriptions were pretty much to the location. For me it was a step back in time. Which made it a 5 star for me. I came in contact with sodium azide when my vehicle ran into a brick wall, which was a choking situation. Maybe it will serve a purpose if everyone would contact their state representatives about how the substance is being left in discarded vehicles. It was refreshing to find a female sheriff in Bisbee, AZ, it being a macho town like so many of the border towns. However Sheriff Joanna Brady does very well being a newcomer investigating a murdered Rochelle, who was in the witness protection program; a second murder, and having to share the investigation with Beaumont. I enjoyed the mystery; it was a quick read with wonderful memories for me.
4	4	I owe my latest payday to Jack Chapman's negotiating strategies. My newest employer aimed pretty low for their first offer, lower than what I had made at my last job, considering all of the skills and experience I was bringing to the table. But by applying some of the techniques in the book, I was able to get 22% more money. I've never negotiated my salary before: I was just glad someone thought enough of my skills to make me an offer. Now, I know better
4	4	This classic is one that everyone should read and maybe even read every year!!
4	4	This text helped me to articulate the 'principles' of Standard English by examining our language in all its varieties scientifically and intuitively. Such articulation necessates a thorough understanding of the notions of descriptive vs. prescriptive, standard vs. nonstandard, formal vs. informal, grammatical vs. ungrammatical, and constitutive vs. regulative. This introductory text is written for the mature student who has had little or no background in linguistics or traditional school grammar. Consequently, the authors begin by demonstrating how traditional grammar instruction with its eight parts of speech and semantic definitions falls terribly short of accounting for the many rule exceptions and illogicalities of langauge. I highly recommend this text for English Education majors and secondary school English teachers.
4	4	I've always had a thought about "REVERAND" Jackson, and this book proves it! Jesse jackson isn't black - He's just a white man that's so full of s**t tha his body long ago lost the ability to absorb it
4	4	Imagine a world where the church ran everything. Sound good? Well, it's not. Just like in the middle ages, this church rules with an iron hand. Since God must be with the church, then opposition to the church is considered witchcraft, and it seemingly comes from Satan. A wonderful view of the negative possibilities should one single religion ever really take over the world. Lieber is a master writer, and this is one of his very best novels
4	4	I loved it and look forward to more of her books. The lead character was very likable and it was fun watching her journey through the break-up and divorce and how she was able to cope. It is a book of hope for anyone who has had marital problems or just pure fantasy and fun for those who have not
4	4	I can use "picture book" to describe Full Moon, as images contributed as the major part of this book. Don't think that this book is not worth reading, indeed, it is on the contrary, this is an extraordinary book, because of the photos. There are a lot of astronomy books contain lots of photos, but when you read them, you would find the images are not so good at all, but not because of the photo itself, because of the low resolution. And if you are familiarize with those photos, you would immediately notice that the original photo is not so small in resolution. It is really a very bad idea for the publisher and editor to ignore the importance of image resolution. However, when you first look into Full Moon, you will find you're getting into a different world as you are already delighted by the spectacular images of the Moon taken from Apollo Mission. Normally, owing to the technological limitation in 1960s and 1970s, all images are only mostly available as hard copy and not so high resolution. However, Project Full Moon can turn those hard copies into very high resolution images. I can even tell you that, NASA even don't have such high resolution images before. Since these reasons, I would rank this book as my list of Top 10 Astronomy Book. If you really love astronomy, you must not miss this book, miss the extraordinary journey to the Moo
0	1	I have just a very few words to say about this not too inventive construct " Its undeniably the most implausible book i've ever read on any subject "
1	1	I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down. Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that. The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour. It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read. The book just stops. Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel. It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with. In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae. Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that. Gee, what a lovely sofa..
4	4	This is a book unlike any other I have read. C.S. Lewis calls MacDonald his master but I couldn't figure out why until I read this book. Lilith is complex and stunning in its depth and imagery. I felt awakened after I read it.
1	1	I am a Panama (Just Cause) & Desert Shield/Storm vet, and after seeing the movie I read the book... well almost all of it. This guy is a problem child PERIOD! Pissed off at the world, pissed off at life, and very lucky I didn't get my hands on him. Snipers are crazy as another review stated, but this guy is that 5% of the Corps that that can give the other 95% a bad name. Some of the boredom issues were true, wives/girlfriends dumping us was true, etc... but overall this guy just REALLY ticked me off... but THAT IS HIS GOAL IN LIFE ISN'T IT... Books about God, Country, Corps; things that are still thought, and observed by every Marine may just not shock the masses as much as a book aboutsome discontented, nonhacker, shiptbird.
1	1	I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help
1	1	The book contains the complete works of Arthur Rimbaud in chronological order, in both English and French. There is an excellent short introduction to Rimbaud, along with a very nice explanation of the translation process, and the difficulties inherent in translating poetry. Sadly, the translations presented in this volume do a grave injustice to Rimbaud. In his efforts to render an accurate contemporary translation, Mason removes nearly every vestige of poetic rhythm and rhyme from his poems. Even though my French is inadequate to enjoy Rimbaud in his original language, I found myself turning frequently to the French versions of the poems, as I tried to understand how a poet of Rimbaud's reputation could possibly write so poorly. In poem after poem, the French version was more readable than Mason's translation even though I could only understand about a third of what I read. I ended up exchanging the book for a version translated by Paul Schmidt, which was much more readable. Ironically, Mason offers criticism of Schmidt's translation in his book. While this book might be a worthwhile addition to the library of someone already familiar with Rimbaud, I would recommend that any person seeking an introduction to his poetry look elsewhere for a translation

4	4	Making friends should come naturally, but to many kids with a range of social/learning difficulties, it's as foreign as hieroglyphics. These special, often exceptionally talented, children become lost in the simplest social situa-tions. Murrell's thorough and finely illustrated book covers the basics for navigating our strange world and custom
0	1	Overall, this book was terrible. I will start with the few excellent points this book made: Many celebrities have horrendous families (3 kids from 3 different men, for example), but this is overlooked while it is practically the only thing people say about poor women (ex: "Welfare Mothers"). The chapter on Welfare Mothers had lots of good points in it-it was worth reading. They make the point that parents are too "child-centered" now. It is true that some parents let their kids have way too much control and give them way more material goods and attention than they need. Kids don't really need much of either. However, what these authors are promoting is extremely opposite of "child-centered." The marketing of products moms "need" is out of control. Many moms waste money on irrelevant products and really need to be aware of the marketing aimed at them to try to get them to buy tons of junk. You need to be smart about marketing, good point. But... then.... the authors make a comment like this: "While it was certainly true that many mothers were looking for toys that were stimulating and compensated for the fact that America still had no national day care or nursery school system, the toy industry always suggested that the new marketing trends were entirely driven by mothers." That's right, it's the lack of national day care that is causing me to become rampantly materialistic! No matter what the problem, these authors will find someone/something to blame it on. Now, to all the other things that I did not like about this book (where to start!): The authors go on and on and on about celebrities and how they are portrayed as perfect mothers and workers. Give me a break. Women have to be smarter than to actually believe this nonsense. Please don't blame People for making you feel guilty as a mother. Celebrities are not even in the same class as the rest of us. They can't even compare their lives to ours. And, if they try, you must know it is a bunch of baloney. If you don't want to read about celebrity babies, don't buy People. Don't watch ET. It's really not hard to avoid if it affects you so much. Although the authors think pointing to a few isolated daycare incidents is no evidence of problems with childcare (they vehemently defend daycares, even ones that are investigated for crimes against children), they seem eager to make a point that a few other isolated cases- Andrea Yates, Susan Smith, babies in dumpsters- is obviously calling attention to a problem with the new "momism." This is the scapegoat for these women who killed their children. No matter what your parenting problem, the authors have an excuse for you! "Dumb Men, Stupid Choices- Or Why We Have No Childcare:" The authors open with a description of a WWII daycare center. The few that were actually like this were open 24 hours and did your laundry and grocery shopping while you worked, along with meal prep, and taking care of sick children in a special place in the center (which were no doubt this nice because they were a temporary solution for women called from home to do their civic duty). The authors are saying this is what it should be like today...... So then the authors go on to bash everyone who doesn't agree with their childcare position. Then they bring out this stat: "By 1995, 75 percent of kids under five were regularly watched by someone other than their parents." They are implying that 75% of women out there need/want government daycare centers. First of all, that statistic is ridiculous. The 75% stat includes part-time moms (which are about ¬Ω of the 75%). Some of these moms work very few hours, other do "split shifts" with their spouse so their children don't have to go to daycare. Many part-time kids are playing with grandma or auntie and cousins. I really doubt these kids would rather be in big, govt. daycare. Now, of the roughly 37% of moms working full-time, the percentage that have to work to make ends meet is very small. If you also look at the preferences of poor women who have to work, they overwhelmingly like home based and relative care for their children-not huge govt. daycare. They also overwhelmingly, if given a choice, would rather stay home and raise their own children. So, the authors of this book are pushing for a childcare system, of enormous cost, that is the least popular option and will serve a minority of working mothers. Then this comment, "Many young mothers who need a salary-and, frankly, time away from the kids-feel they have no choice but to quit their jobs, either for the sake of the kids, or because they simply can't afford the childcare near them." Are these authors suggesting that the taxpayers pick up the bill for moms who want to get out of the house and work for fun? It sure sounds like it! The authors act like there are no honest women out there who enjoy motherhood. The authors are clearly blinded by their own feelings. I'm really not sure why women like these authors feel a calling to publish books trying to convince the public that happy, fulfilled mothers are a "myth." It's not. In the chapter: "Dr. Laura's Neighborhood" (and in the rest of this book) we learn that if you are a: man, home-schooling mom (except a few minority who the authors think are OK), attachment parenting mom, Christian, conservative, someone who likes organically grown food, happy mother, a member of the "Greatest Generation," someone who likes decorating, pro-life, breastfeeding mom, mother of multiple babies (they especially like to attack you if you used fertility drugs) or a SAHM-you are NOT approved by these authors! These authors are pompous and arrogant, thinking they are the be-all-end-all to judge others. These women are clearly driven by some irrational rage against all other mothers who are not exactly like them. The women who wrote this book are the type that will sneer at you in Traget because your child is crying or having a tantrum. They are the types who would turn the other way and let the door slam in your face when you are trying to get your stroller out an non-automatic door. And watch out if you are on their "most hated" list because you would get the extra-extra dirty look. This book reads like a nasty note you would find on the floor of a high school, written by a girl who is jealous of the girls in another clique.
4	1	Thomas Paine's &quot;Rights of Man&quot; is truly a classic defense of self government and reprsentative republicanism. Paine copmletely demolishes Edmund Burke's defense of aristocracy and monarchy as outmoded and absurd institiutions. Paine shows the immorality of monarchy and the plunder that it commits on it's own people through high taxes,unjust property laws,and priveleges for the nobility. Paine shows the virtues a representative system has over the monarchial form. He denounces aristocracy and monarchy as &quot;frauds&quot; and based upon tyranny. The first review by Will Murphy critsizing Paine as a sort of statist is way off the mark. Paine did recommend many ideals of the welfare state. It must be remembered he was speaking to an age where a large wealthy aristocracy ruled alongside the monarch, living in luxury off the high taxes drained from the middle, lower and working classes. Paine was one of the formost defenders of freethought in religion,speech, and ideas.To imply Paine was a sort of 18th century fascist is utterly absurd and ahistorical. Paine was not an enemy of property, just an enemy of aristocracy,who in his day did not obtain property by hard work. Usually property rights in monarchial nations were written to favor the wealthy and powerful, and grant them priveleges at the expense of the populace. Paine completely destroys the ideal that a chosen few were meant or ordained by God to rule. If you love freedom, you can't go wrong with the &quot;Rights of Man&quot;

0	1	I bought this book for .25 cents at a yard sale. Boy did I waste my quarter! I found NO new meditation techniques in this little rag. It is clear to understand why the sales ranking of this book is only 608,394. This is your basic, "You know the envision white light garbage and hold your breath to the count of ......". You know the same junk that all charlatons teach. This book is pitiful at best.
1	4	After reading about half of this book, I had to stop. I am not very inspired. In fact, it had the opposite effect on me. A lot of the stories I read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had. Kind of scared me a bit..is this what I have to look forward to as the years progress? I was more inspired by Montel's book (once I got past the ego part of it)

0	1	The reason I don't recommend this book, despite the nice writing and decriptions of the Western Highlands, is for one dark fact: a number of wild otters died for Maxwell's selfish pursuit of having a wild animal as a pet. This is not the story of a man who raises abandoned wild otters cubs in the Western Highlands and releases them but the story of a man who takes otters from the wild in Iraq and Africa and tries to raise them in Scotland. What this story also tells us is that, if you are of a privillaged class, you can have any wild animal you want as your pet. Today this is illegal "pet" trading and it is responsible for pushing certain species to the edge of extinction. I know that at the time this practice was not looked down upon as it is today and certain other nature writers (Durrell, Heinrich) engage in the same practice but with a more educated populus it should be clear: wild animals are not pets and they should stay wild
1	4	I am a great fan of Saylor's historical novels, but was very disappointed by this one. His skill has always been in creating completely believable environments, down to the smallest details, and placing his stories within those frameworks. But the vast scope of this novel(?) makes that kind of meticulous detail impossible. Everything, including the prose, in this book seems somehow pale and uninspired-- a writer biting off more than he can chew, or, to vary the image, spreading himself way too thin. The book reminds me of James Michener's old pot-boiler, "The Source." Saylor at his best is one-hundred times the writer Michener was, but I enjoyed Michener's book more than Saylor's, which I simply could not finish. Nothing about it engaged me

4	1	Maggie Balistreri's critique of our masked, substantively evasive dialect offers humorous, albeit troubling, insight into how much of the social fabric, the prevailing belief structures and cultural processes, are entrenched in mass denial, subsisting on and predicated upon the avoidance of truth and meaning within common, everday conversations and exchanges. Think of it as speaking in riddles. Unfortunately, it's done considerable damage in shaping the broader public discourse. This particular deficiency is widely adhered to on an unconscious level, to the extent that it's accepted as 'normal'. Let's suppose that the majority of a population shared a common mental illness, a soul sickness; isn't it possible, even likely, that over time, a greater percentage of them would be unable to acknowledge the disease ...*as a disease?* And by that postulation, wouldn't the afflicted then in turn deem those not likewise effected by it as the ones who are sick, weird, bad, wrong, etc? With people generally unaware of this process(and likely uninterested in it)they are incapable of acknowledging how cognition and grammer are fused in a manner indicative of a deficient, or at least insufficient, mode of consciousness and expression which is congrous to self deception, mass deception, and in turn, self and societal censorship. This elaborate process largely stems from the "Just Do It" corporatized mentality. The underlying, strategic message of "Just Do It" is DON'T THINK. That is, don't think beyond the superficialities of life: of a mindless, wage slave existence relegated to the various conformities of rampant consumerism, and all it entails to define human worth and "success" on such terms. When people don't think beyond those terms, when the customary, daily round of life is beset with a deluge of incentives and inducements toward desensitization and immediate gratification rooted in the manipulation and exploitation of innate human insecurities, often through induced signals and social cues concerning inadequacy, fear, anxiety, the result is an unthinking, non critical, homogeneous conformity among the populace where the surrender or denial of critical thought, genuine expression and emotional respression is widely encouraged, enabling an overall acceptance and exaltation of a unique spiritual and intellectual paralysis. Logically it follows that since most are environmentally impacted and absorbed into this deficiency, its symptoms and manifestations are largely viewed as the opposite of what they really are, allowing for a delusional, happy consciousness. Language reflects this. My take on what Maggie is addressing in her book isn't a random social trend, and that there isn't necessarily a direct correlation with this dilemma and a person's overall intelligence or vocabulary; it's an inevitable byproduct of poisonous, corporatized values. The proof is how corporate power, which is basically the hierarchy of government, so obviously benefits in every way from the crisis of social and spiritual declivity. The greater the degree of ignorance, apathy, and general disharmony, the greater profits to be made from human misery, and the more draconian measures that can be implemented by exploiting the symptoms which then serves to frighten people into being less independent minded and more stupified, perpetuating the cycle. The psychological dynamics of these cycles are fairly simple to figure out provided people are encouraged to do so. If they're not sufficiently roused into paying attention to matters of great public import(something that the media should do but of course does just the opposite)than naturally, the people's language and efforts of communication are going to reflect a particularly narrow mindset.

4	4	17 years later and many things have changed. The desire of investors to accurately gauge the stability of the companies in their portfolios remains the same. The incentive of management with stock options to hide the true nature of what the reality of what the company's earnings have been remains strong. Some of the techniques mentioned will be hard to use when companies employ SPEs to hide their true indebtedness and derivative positions mask the Value at Risk. However, many of the technique still have value. The analysis of receivables and inventories can provide insight into the immediate future of the company. The techniques that have lost their clear edge are the debt and write-off analysis. Write-offs are now required by GAAP (although the "big bath" write-offs are still "non-recurring") and SPEs or variable interest entities can obscure debt. It is fascinating in light of Enron, WorldCom, Qwest, Tyco, and Adelphia the stories of companies in the 70s and 80s that were attempting to do the same thing (though often without the fraud). How little man changes through the ages
3	4	Lincoln Rhyme, detective extraordinaire and forensics expert, is hot on the trail of a chinese human smuggler/terrorist nicknamed The Ghost. A couple of the illegal immigrants being shipped to the US have escaped, are in hiding, and are being hunted down by The Ghost. The combined forces of the NYPD, FBI, as well as the INS must stop him before all of immigrants are taken out. Jeffery Deaver excels here and one can almost perceive the inspiration of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Sonny Li, an undercover cop from China, is the most outstanding character in the book. Since most detective thrillers are generic, it's good to come across splendid work like this. Lincoln Rhyme fans obviously will enjoy The Stone Monkey, but initiates will also be thrilled by it
1	4	I have been greatly been disappointed in this book. I am a total Francophile and soak up just about any book on life in southern France, be it travelogue, novel, cultural study, etc. I have been reading Map of Another Town over the past few months and it's been a struggle. MFK Fisher goes into painfully boring and unnecessary detail on the most insignificant things, like having to go back and forth between offices and buildings while seeking the appropriate vaccinations for a trip to Africa, and what she thinks of every little thing related to the process. She'll devote pages and pages to experiences that have nothing to do with live in Aix-en-Provence and its environs -- it's a map of her own head, where she spends too much time. She finds herself rather fascinating, but I found her self-centered. I thought it would be interesting to read about life there in the 1950s and 1960s, but again, the book is less a cultural study than autobiographical ramblings (if you can find it, Village in the Vaucluse, a Laurence Wylie cultural study first written in 1957 and updated in 1967 and 1974, is fascinating and was one of my college texts for a French culture course -- 5 stars plus.). I probably will not even bother with A Considerable Town and will finish Map of Another Town only because I feel like I should. If you are considering this book because life in southern France fascinates you, I would instead recommend any of the Peter Mayle books (not jumping on the bandwagon here; I've read his books from the beginning and own all of them, and his writing style is absolutely delightful and endearing, even when he's being a snob), Yvone Lenard, etc. In fact, Peter Mayle's books so charmingly describe Provence that they serve as a guidebook to the best the region has to offer, so you can visualize and plan your own trip. With his writing style, it feels like you're along for the trip, whereas with MFK Fisher, you wonder when you're going to get there.
1	3	Although the author does a very good job putting the text of the plays into the modern English vernacular, I feel as though the works have had their flavor removed. If you are a purist, like I am, stick to the "old" translation.
1	4	This book is analagous to buying a new elliptical, anxiously opening the user manual to find out how this new piece of equipment is going to benefit you, only to find page after page outlining the technical details of the inner workings of the machine with the last sentence or so briefly mentioning the effects the machine can have on your life. The author is obviously an expert on the subject of astronomy and how it relates to ancient historical monuments, but he is so caught up in the technical details that "the transformation of our consciousness" is brushed aside as an afterthought. Instead, the author drones on and on and on about monuments, angles, precessions, measurements etc. It's obviously necessary to briefly cover the technical aspects to build a foundation for the more exciting stuff to come, but this book never builds on that foundation. There were brief moments when I thought the book started to get really interesting, but the author would quickly revert back to the same old empirical, newtonian shallowness with more chapters that should have been titled, "who gives a [...]." John Major Jenkins is not really interested in the metaphysical side of this subject, and if you don't believe me, I quote page 239 of this book..."as a reminder, my work is not really to identify a mechanism that could empirically explain why a solstice-galaxy alignment might have transformative effects for life on Earth." My question is then why mention the transformation of consciousness in the title when it's hardly mentioned in the book? You would think that the benfits and effects of the sun aligning with the galactic center is going to have on our consciousness would be the main focus, since after all, it's what most of us should be most concerned with. If you are preparing for a test in astronomy, this book is for you. 2 stars for the misleading title.

4	4	Written by Frank Miller and hauntingly illustrated by David Mazzucchelli, YEAR ONE was serialized in Batman #404-407. It tells of the first calendar year in which Batman emerged in Gotham City, beginning with Bruce Wayne returning to Gotham after studying martial arts abroad. Wayne becomes a vigilante, at first without the Batman outfit, at first fumbling a bit. The sequence in which he conceives of the outfit takes the old clich√© from Batman history of a bat crashing through the window and transforms it into a moving moment; YEAR ONE gives similar treatment to flashbacks showing the murder of Wayne's parents. In a city dominated by gangsters before the ascent of insane costumed criminals, Batman encounters Catwoman, here depicted as a whore who takes to the street with frustrations about gender, her sadomasochistic elements heightened. James Gordon becomes a fully-realized character for the first time, adjusting from his move from Chicago to Gotham, where the police force is dominated by corruption. He investigates Batman, suspects Wayne, has an affair, and ultimately has his child kidnapped and rescued by the vigilante he sought to bring down. In a tough city, he goes from crusader against Batman to the first stages of his relationship with Batman. A masterful work, BATMAN: YEAR ONE possesses a level of realism greater than perhaps any Batman tale and, with a breakneck pace, does the hard work of describing the humble beginnings of Batman's career, performing in the process a remarkable process of infusing Bruce Wayne, James Gordon, and Selina Kyle with true character, personality, and history. This is the second best Batman story ever made, second only (perhaps) to THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. -- Julian Darius, Sequart.com (for sophisticated study of comic books and graphic novels
4	4	Alex Cross is back, and this time he's after The Butcher, the man who killed Alex's wife some ten years ago and has been raping and killing ever since. This character, The Butcher, is one of the more colorful in Cross' bag of collared criminals, and much of the book is spent in The Butcher's POV, which adds texture and depth to this novel. Alex and his near-constant depression can be boring at times, when he's fretting over Nana's workload, how little time he spends with his kids, whether he could have done more to stop the murder of Maria, his wife, some ten years ago. But Alex gets out of his funk long enough to track down The Butcher, and this is a chase I enjoyed. Whether or not Alex will get bored in private practice and will go back to the FBI is a story line that didn't move me, so I'm hoping he decides to go back, but Patterson has another hit with CROSS, and this series just keeps going. For that, I am thankful
1	4	This was required reading for my son going into fifth grade. He is not a strong reader, and neither he nor I enjoyed it. The combination of a large amount of flowery language and very little action made it a struggle to get through. What little humor there was, was too sophisticated. It was hard for us to identify with this foppish married mouse who ate caviar and champagne. While I can appreciate that many (I guess most!) find it literary and delicious, my son found it boring, and looking at it through his eyes, I have to agree
3	4	I finished Kaplan's Ends of the Earth today. I liked the book. Kaplan has consistently been one of my favorite authors (Atlantic Monthly) His theme is consistent: many nation states are not really nation states. I felt that his comments about Iran were especially poignant, given how some view Iran as part of the "Axis of Evil". I get the sense that when this book was written, Kaplan had great hope for the future of Iran as they struggle with theocracy. Ecocide, or the killing of natural resources is a new topic for me that Kaplan introduces. According to Kaplan, many developing nations have traded immediate benefits for the long term health of their natural resources. His observations are very very interesting, especially his observations from the post-Soviet nations like Uzbekistan. Kaplan is a bold, imaginative and thoughtful writer, he is not merely another journalist or another travel writer. His message, right or wrong, is sincere and based on his own personal observations. I highly recommend this work for anyone interested on new perspectives in current affairs.
0	1	I was exposed to this book in what I think is the most unfortunate way possible, it was read to my child in her public school Kindergarten class. I was stunned and emotional when she came home and told me her teacher told her that a candy cane was a J for Jesus, and that the red stripes were his blood, and if she loved Jesus the white would wash it away. My child is five years old, and was disturbed by the whole thing. This book has no part of the Christmas story in it, and the tasteless metaphor of it is impossible for a young child to understand. The illustration is graphic and also not age appropriate. The only good that has come from this absurd destruction of an innocent holiday treat is that now I am even more communicative and vigilant about my child's education and exposure, even in the school I trust with my child's life and well-being
0	1	Big disappointment. I expected this book to be hysterical. Her sense of humor is certainly different! Very shallow material. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal
4	1	One of the major reasons why radical feminism remains such a destructive influence on the lives of Americans is that it claims to speak for women when it really only represents a minute percentage of them. The feminista activist has proved quite adept at obscuring this fact by labeling their critics as "patriarchal, anti-woman" and "sexist." The irony lost on many is that no social movement in history has so thoroughly undermined the constituency they pretended to represent. As always, the opinions of males are discounted, and whatever words men write are deemed compromised, so let us be grateful that Carrie Lukas came along. She is an equity feminist in the mold of Christina Hoff Sommers and Daphne Patai, and what many readers already know is that equity feminist is to gender or radical feminist what the Green Berets are to terrorists. Lukas's new book is an insightful answer to the pervasive lies so often told about men. Her main theme is that differences between the sexes exist, and there's no reason to label them as good or evil. Viva la difference should be the order of every day. By the end, you'll be pleased that she took the time to pen such an eloquent refutation of the alleged, and fictional, patriarchy. Lukas rationally cuts through the lies and distortions which so poison our ether. You'll find skillful refutations to canards like men being the primary cause of domestic violence, that divorce is beneficial to women, and that being born with a particular kind of genitalia enables one to "have it all." The real problem with gender feminists is that their need to dominate and control others is far more important to them than their supposed goal of bettering the lives of women. Behind their hysterical passion hides a collective of dominatrixes. The only thing that their politics uniformly promote is an increase in their own status and increased feelings of self-righteousness. On aggregate, Lukas's narrative voice is outstanding as she is the possessor of an analytical and dispassionate mind. In my opinion, she even provides a more balanced assessment of radical positions than they actually deserve. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that I suspect few women will read it. My guess is that this is due to its not being feel good or warm-fuzzy enough for them. What those who habitually avoid the non-comforting forget is that knowing the truth is an end in itself, and that a hard chair made of wood is still more soothing than one made wholly from imagination.
3	4	"The Vietnam Plays, Volume Two," by David Rabe, contains two plays: "Streamers" and "The Orphan," together with a 1992 afterword by the author. The book includes production information on both plays. "Streamers" was produced and staged in 1976, and "The Orphan" was first produced professionally in 1973. "Streamers" looks at a group of Army soldiers who are facing the possibility of being sent to Vietnam while the war is going on. Rabe focuses on a group of three roommates, all junior soldiers. As these troops talk and argue together with the other soldiers in the play, Rabe shows how tensions within the military can create fracture lines along many axes of difference: race, sexual orientation, educational background, rank. Early on in the play Rabe introduces the theme of homosexuality in the army; this theme plays a significant role as the story unfolds. Also explored is the relationship between younger troops and experienced combat veterans. "Streamers" is a play that may seem a deceptively straightforward slice of military life, but I found it to be a dense and complex text, rich in irony, that rewards careful reading. It's a powerful play that effectively presents a group of military personnel as a microcosmic world of tension, lust, anxiety, anger, and violence. Particularly piercing is Rabe's look at the intersection of verbal "violence" and physical violence. I found "The Orphan" far less interesting than its companion piece. In it Rabe melds ancient Greek lore with late-20th century American concerns. Although the play has some strong moments, overall I felt it lacked effectiveness. I felt that Rabe missed a golden opportunity to really use the Trojan and Vietnam wars to shed light on each other. Nevertheless, the presence of "Streamers" in this volume makes the book well worth owning, especially for those with an interest in the literature of war. Recommended companion text for "Streamers": "A Sense of Honor," a novel by James Webb
4	4	This great work by Phil Yancey was the Christian book of the year in the 70's, and has lasted the test of time. This is easily the best book on the subject of pain and suffering that I have read; it's teachings are on the mark and scriptural. Yancey nails it when he writes that the suffering in this world is a democracy; that we are all part of it, we all suffer, and we all can help. He makes some fine points considering all areas of the subject. He clearly balances the sovereignty of God and His will with our blessings as His children and our works. He hits on sowing and reaping, as well as the fact that just like Job, sometimes bad things happen to us not as a direct result of anything we did. What I like best is Yancey dives right in, going to Leper colonies and interviewing with people who have suffered life-time dehabilitating injuries. It's interesting to see how they've coped and how they view God, and how their suffering has changed their personal relationship with God. Indeed suffering is universal, yet there is no universal answer behind the causes of it or how to deal with it. I've heard pastors preach that people have died because they smoked cigarrettes, or got a sexually transmitted disease because of permiscuous sex. But the question begs to be asked, what about those who did those things and didn't die? Is it different for a Christian as opposed to a non-Christian? What man on this earth walks close enough with God to have the power to decide what sin resulted in what judgment? If earthquakes are a judgment from God,... are headaches a judgment from God too? And it's certainly an issue that none of us should be pompous about. One reviewer gave this book a one-star rating, saying that "God gives suffering when believers desecrate his house." This is a type of religious crap that this book dispells. Isn't it true that none of us are righteous; even our righteous acts are like filthy rags to the Lord? Then are we categorizing sin by saying that homosexuality can destroy a nation, but the hateful attitude of a right-wing pastor cannot? If Christians who tithe are to be blessed by God, then why have some 'tithers' went bankrupt, while some athiests (and Christian false-teachers) become million-aires? Did 9/11 happen because of the liberal and homosexual communities, as said Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson? Or did it in fact happen because W and the family have gotten in bed financially with Saudi Arabia and other Muslim nations, none of which give a rats a__ about America, and even profited from 9/11 when America spent billions on weapons and defense programs..... run by Saudis. Only a true biblical view of the causes and lessons of suffering can help our walk with God to be more fruitful. You'll find no faith/health/prosperity quick fixes in this one. You'll also find nobody on this earth who knows all the answers. This book definitely gives power to that journey with Jesus Christ, however. Just wondering.... a reviewer of this book has declared a "Chinese victory over the USA", and that China is a 'more Christian nation'. Woa, dude. They must have better drugs in China too, apparently
1	1	I purchased this book thinking that it would have good ways to make my boring room look a bit interesting, but I, as a thirteen-year-old, wasn't impressed with the ideas in the book. Condratitory to what the author says, the projects were NOT fun, NOT cheap, NOT for a teen audience, NOT interesting, and NOT a good addition to your room whatsoever. The four themes in this book, which include flowers, teddy bears, funky, and nature, all look as if they were made for the ten-and-under age group. I mean, seriously, what teen devotes their whole room to TEDDY BEARS and decorate every inch with the strange projects in this book? The ideas for the projects are unoriginal, strange, and lame. For example, some of the ideas suggests that you splatter your bedroom wall with multi-colored paints, make a scrunchie holder out of a recycled soda bottle, put a headboard behind your bed that says "I Love Teddy Bears," and so on. Yeah, I know, it's stupid and immature. So if you want a GOOD book that will give you some GOOD room decorating project ideas, definitely stay clear of this one!
0	4	This book is very out dated!! It is a history of the V6 engine up to the early 80's. Look for a more up to date book
1	1	I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist
0	1	i ordered this book to give me some ideas and decorating tips, what i got are pictures of old flea market items, that have nothing to do with each other. didn't help a bit, and truthfully if it didn't cost so much to return, i'd return it in a second
4	4	Louis' Uncle McAllister lives in Scotland and every year sends Louis the best birthday present. And this year was no different, a tadpole, Louis names Alphonse. But it soon becomes apparent that Alphonse is not your normal, everyday tadpole and definitely not turning into a frog. He soon outgrows his jar, then the kitchen sink, and bathtub. Louis sneaks him into the school swimming pool during summer vacation, and that works out just fine until fall when school opens. In a panic Louis consults Miss Seevers, the librarian. Librarians always have all the answers, and Miss Seevers doesn't let him down. With a phone call to Scotland, a little research, and a lot of ingenuity, Louis and Miss Severs find a clever solution and happily-ever-after ending to their problem..... First published twenty-five years ago, Steven Kellogg's creative classic, The Mysterious Tadpole, is as fresh and entertaining today as it was back in 1977. Mr Kellogg has given his new illustrations a bold and bright facelift, and tweaked the text a bit, but the engaging and fun-filled story with its hilarious twist at the end, is still sure to capture the imagination and warm your heart. Perfect for youngsters 3-7, The Mysterious Tadpole is a timeless treasure to share with friends and family now, and future generations in the years to come
0	4	This book places too much emphasis on spending money instead of eating...well if we all had money to burn that would be a wonderful lifestyle. Read "The Fat Fallacy" instead, it provides much more practical information
1	1	Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises
0	1	Simply disastrous work by Pohl. After throroughly enjoying the original Gateway, I was looking forward to this sequel. My hopes were utterly shattered. In summary, here is why this book was totally unreadable. 1. The main characters, Stan and Estrella, are totally unbelievable. Their dialogue is only slightly above kindergarten level. They are never given any motivation for their actions. 2. Pohl fills the pages with useless details, including information about plantlife, and cooking, as well as vomitting and bowel movements. I gave up on the book completely when he decided to indulge in an entire page about one man going to the toilet. Maybe he was trying to be funny. It didn't work. 3. Total lack of plot development. The book is basically a loosely connected series of random events, stuffed with filler. Mid-way through the book Pohl begins to introduce entirely new characters in an attempt to generate some kind of plot momemntum. I have never read a more unfocussed science fiction novel. It comes off as really poorly done space-opera. 4. Characters are completely flat. Stan and Estrella are both sickeningly dumb. Every other character is the exact same cardboard cutout. Aliens act just like humans except they talk funny. It is very cheesy and lacks any attempt at originality. 5. Book has an insane number of sex scenes, and they are all badly written. I mean literally, you cannt go more than 15 pages without a sex scene. So juvenile. I would go on, but I believe my point is made. This book has not a single redeeming feature. If you enjoyed Gateway, DO NOT ruin your memory of it by reading this sequel.

"We will stick with Rick" and his Deer Burger Cookbook and Bag Em and Tag Em
4	4	I have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the BEST book for interviews. The information I have learned from this book applies to almost ANY interview not just the police one. I found that I had already begun categorizing people so I knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business. I am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview. I feel EXTREMELY prepared for the interview thanks to this book
1	1	I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this. Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN. It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am." I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable. I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware. Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible
1	1	Danielle Steel has done it once again. Written a book that must have taken her all of one day. I was really disappointed after Summer in St. Tropez, but thought after a break from her books I'd try again. Sorry I wasted my time. This book is SO repetitive, same phrases are not only repeated chapter after chapter but in the same paragraph. The story line seems to drag on forever. If Steel's goal is to "dumb" her books down for the masses then she has succeeded. This book is written at about an 11-year-old's level. Don't waste your time
4	4	*disclaimer: I am writing this as a philosopher of mind so any parts of the book or chapters not related to this are not what I am addressing.* I do not mean to say that Bennett and Hacker have all the answers, but their "ordinary language" approach, along with their debt to Wittgenstein, Ryle, Kenny and Strawson, says something about their book. Most contemporary philosophers of mind (Sprague, Strawson and Hacker, among others, excluded) have rightly dismissed the soul, but have decided that there is something "mysterious" about consciousness, or perception or emotion, or what have you. In response, Bennett and Hacker have shown what "consciousness" really is: the conscious acts of people existing in the world. This is why we know that other people are conscious actors: they do conscious things such as watch birds, or play chess, or eat ham sandwiches. If Michael Tye's or David Chalmers' or Colin McGinn's problems of consiousness (e.g. that I can know that you feel the same pain that I feel, or that you see the same color that I see) are indeed problems for you, you should read this book; if it doesn't prove to you that they are not problems at all, at least it will give you a new way of looking at the problems so that you may come to your own interesting conclusions
1	1	My mother-in-law presented me with this book in a poor attempt to convert me into Christianity. I tried to read the book as thoroughly as possible. It was difficult to keep interested in the first half of the book. In my personal opinion, the author seems to ramble on about the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on many occasions, this seems to be his only method of proving that the "Bible Code" does in fact, exist. Not to mention his constant reminding that he 'does not believe in God or prophecies.' This gets very tiring. Drosnin does not provide solid evidence, no matter how he tries to dress it up with scientific terms. The author kills his credibility on repeated occasions. Overall, I found this to be an interesting read, but the author's arguements were not convincing enough for me.
4	4	Russel Middlebrook is pretty sure that he's gay. After all, he's not attracted to girls, and he spends every day after gym class studiously avoiding the other half-naked guys in the locker room. He's never had an actual experience with another guy, though, so maybe the attraction he feels toward them is something he'll outgrow--or maybe not. While surfing the Internet one night, he finds chat rooms for different towns and cities, where you can talk to other people who are also gay. And amazingly enough, there's a boy he meets with the name GayTeen-- who not only lives in his town, but also attends his high school. Another gay boy, in his very own school? There's no way that could be true-- especially when he finds out that the kid with the handle GayTeen is none other than Kevin Land, star of the baseball team, one of the most popular guys in school. As Kevin and Russel get to know one another, outside of school and hidden away from prying eyes, they realize that there's no way for them to be together inside school walls. The same is true for Russel's friends Min and Terese, who although they claim to just be really close friends, are actually in love. So along with a few others, including Gunnar, who is straight, and Brian Bund, the loser of Goodkind High School, the boys form The Geography Club. After all, no one else is going to want to join such a boring club--especially if they knew it was just a front for a gay/ lesbian school group. As events at school heat up, with Brian eventually being outed as gay even though he's not, Russel, Kevin, and their friends will have to learn what's most important in life. And that sometimes, no matter how much you might wish for things to be out in the open, you're just not ready. GEOGRAPHY CLUB is a great, quick read from author Brent Hartinger, about the ups and downs of daily high school life, and the struggle to find ones identity

4	4	I love this book! It plays, quite successfully, with Douglas Adams's idea/question of what happens to gods when people stop believing in them? If you like this book you will also enjoy "The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul" by Douglas Adams and "American Gods" by Pratchett's friend Neil Gaimen (though this one is darker and gritty - exploring some of the less flattering parts of America). "Good Omens" by Pratchett and Gaimen is a comedy about the end of the world. If you like the first three books I listed here you will like that one too.
4	4	Dolores did a great at job interviewing Phil in her studies, I found myself realizing that it all makes sense. The historcal gaps in history seemed to be filled with his recounts of earths of civilization thousands of years ago. Not a typical abduction case , but a true eye opener. I related to many things in the book and feel that so much has been confirmed with me. I can't wait for a follow-up with Phil. Personally I Can't wait to read it again
4	4	The book is simply superb!! The use of those magnificent photos to enhance the story was the crowning glory to a story that I not only believe, but experience in my own spirit. It is time for the glorious feminine to rise again and, hopefully, repair the damage done to humanity by the mutated females - men. Lois C. Web
1	1	My main interest in reading the book was for the information about the Nazi fascination with the Occult. I was hoping for something as stimulating as Mel Gordon's HANUSSEN: HITLER'S JEWISH CLAIRVOYANT. I was greatly disappointed. Christopher Hale's HIMMLER'S CRUSADE doesn't really deliver what it promises. Hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult, asserts that only Himmler took such notions seriously (but was indulged by those seeking favors from him) and then moves on to other matters. The book draws no real conclusion other than "Nazis were evil," which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book. (I think I knew that before I even started reading the book.) Hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling. For a while it seems as though the book is about Schaeffer, who led the expedition, then toward the end, it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition (and the people with whom THEY interacted). The author goes off on lots of tangents, giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story. After having invested several weeks in reading the book, I am not sure what the point of it was. The most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in Tibet, but the trip to Tibet actually takes up only about half the book. The rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of Nazism. It seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility. The author, Christopher Hale, is a British TV documentarist. This book is an appendix to his TV show. I found it very difficult reading. In addition to its lack of focus, I just don't think Hale is very comfortable with the printed word. There are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage. Perhaps his TV show was interesting, but the book was a chore to read. In addition, the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative, apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence. Several times throughout the book, the author, a Briton, makes outlandish parallels between America and Nazi Germany, which he doesn't bother to back up (because he can't). Perhaps one can get away with this in a TV documentary, but not in a book, where the reader can back up and say, "Wait a minute. That's a bunch of crap. Where is the evidence are you basing that statement on?" The book is also rife with typographical errors (some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example "role" is spelled "roll") and misusages of words. It appears to have not been edited at all. I give this book one and a half stars, but let's round it off to two just for the research the author has done. (His bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book.) I just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting
4	4	This book goes behind the scenes of the professional and amateur world of organized chess. It is very entertaining because not many people (even die hard chess players themselves) have experiences of this nature in the realm of chess politics. The man has done it all and it was fun to read about his spectacular path! Mr. Schultz' love for chess is clear and his accounts of his chess past are entertaining. He tells of the good and he tells of the bad and a lot of humorous little anecdotes in between. If you play chess with any seriousness, this book is certainly an educational tool in terms of understanding how the big organizations like FIDE and USCF operate. However, this book is very suitable for non-chessplayers as well in that there is no actual chess positions or analysis. It is a story of a man's chess life and political career and I found it to be well done
0	1	I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this. I just don't get it. The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.
4	4	This is a very well designed book for an art teacher with small children. It gives lots of ideas for art projects
0	4	The book is full of useless fillings. Finding your colors is limited to few hair and eye color combinations. It also depends on you doing a test with different colored fabrics & determing how the color reflect against your skin. After reading the book, I still don't know what my colors are. Besides, with so many different color hues on the market, how can one tell if what you're buying is an ever green or true green for example, confusing. The lack of pictures showing the types of collars they're recommending for different body types (e.g Mandarin collar,cowl,bardot...)...is annoying,to say the least. Questionnaires are poorly structured, & the section on makeup, underwear & accessories is trivial. Save your money (i'm glad the book I read was a borrow from the library) and save your time. Pass
3	4	You can argue all you want about qualifications of Mr. Cherniske. But I will say that my daily caffiene intake was from 600-1100mg a day for years, I quit cold turkey about a month before I started reading the book...and the withdrawal was incredible....headaches, shakes, irritable beyond belief. You can't say this isn't an additive drug while you're slugging down four or more startbucks coffees a day. For months and months I've had hard a time sleeping, waking up in the morning feeling like I have no energy at all. Within two weeks of quitting caffien, I feel great. I still go to bed at 11:30-midnight and get up the same time at 5:45am, yet in the morning I can now get up without any problems and I'm awake the whole day without fatigue, feeling more energized. I CHANGED NOTHING ELSE IN MY DIET OR ROUTINE. I still eat the same stuff as before and have not started exorcizing, or most of all...have taken NONE of the suggested suppliments in the book. The only thing I did was stop drinking coffee/coke and started drinking more water. So save yourself a few bucks if you don't want to buy the book, but do yourself a favor and cut out caffiene. The withdrawal sucks, but it doesn't last for ever. If anything once you get through it, it will give you reason to stay away from caffeine. Da
3	4	Just remember "A man a plan a canal Panama" reads front to back and back to front Great book by a great author.
4	4	At first blush, the Everard family doesn't look like much on which to base a series of heroic sailors. Hugh, drummed out of the service before the war in some unnamed scandal but pulled back in because of the emergency, is in love with his brother John's wife. John, a general in the army in France, does not make an appearance, but his sons Nick and David do. Nick is feckless and irresponsible, just one step ahead of being drummed out of the Royal Navy himself, while David is more professional if somewhat dull. That in the course of the book, one's opinion of everyone changes 180 degrees is a tribute to the author's skill at both showing character development and also at revealing a character's past layer by layer, like peeling an onion. The criticism commonly made about this book merely shows the inability of some critics to appreciate the intent of the book they are reviewing. Yes, the book is choppy and yes, it is hard to follow the course of the action. One's initial impulse is to wish for maps and an appendix, but then you realize that this is the whole point. Fullerton's goal is to present to the reader exactly how fighting the Battle of Jutland felt to those who were there. Jutland was a confusing battle and it was many days before those who were there had the foggiest notion of the sequence of events. Fullerton has studied the battle carefully and everything that happened in real life happens here at exactly the same time. But you can't construct a coherent whole out of the narrative, just as even Lord Jellicoe wasn't able to do so. For that, you need to consult another book (I would recommend Rules of the Game by Andrew Gordon, which is not only the finest description of the battle, but one of the finest works of military history), but do it after you read this book, so that you get the full flavor of the writer's intent. Very few writers capture the fog of war as well as Fullerton does
4	4	Got this when it came out and gave it a read. Three years have passed and I just referred to it to support writing a paper on technology. The details are good and the higher level dialogue do a nice job of getting the message across without belaboring anything. If you are about the web and doing business, this is worth the bucks and time
0	1	I enjoyed the movie Claire of the Moon, but when I read the book I found it to be a bit sophomoric. I am not a fan of "cookie cutter" type novels and She Walks in Beauty would definately fall into that catagory in my opinion. Even if I had mounds of free time I would not spend much of it on this book, it's an extreme let down.
4	4	After reading Kingston's &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; I thought I'd read &quot;China Men.&quot; I am not disapointed at all. &quot;China Men&quot; is an excellent biographical work that recounts the lives of Chinese men in America from the 1840s to the Vietnam War. Although Kingston uses as much Chinese myth in this book as she does in &quot;The Woman Warrior,&quot; she apparently decided to keep the mythology and biography more separated. Even so, Kingston's stories and the way in which she recounts them is absolutely splendid
3	4	Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1985, this thoughtful character novel focuses on Macon Leary, a travel writer who hates to travel, a man who has gone through life observing what is happening, but who has never been truly engaged. Compulsively tidy, Macon has always believed that it is possible to order one's life so effectively that the untidiness, or chaos, that throws life into confusion can be avoided. And then his beloved 12-year-old son is cold-bloodedly murdered in the senseless robbery of a burger joint while he is away at camp for the first time. It gives away nothing of the plot to say that this event totally undoes Macon and his wife, and their polite and predictable marriage goes into a tailspin. When the novel opens, Macon and Sarah have decided to separate, with Sarah getting her own apartment (where she can be as messy as she wants) and Macon remaining in the house with his son Ethan's undisciplined dog Edward. In fact, Macon has moved back with his sister and brothers in the family house, to recuperate from his physical wounds--an accident in which he breaks his leg-- and from his emotional wounds. Then into his life comes Muriel, a divorcee with an over-protected, allergic, and hypersensitive son. She is a dog trainer, a flake, the only person willing to undertake the task of civilizing the aggressive, sometimes vicious "pet" that lives with Macon. As Macon tries to deal with his life, his loss of Sarah (who is dating), his son's dog (which attacks anything that moves), and his commitment to producing yet another travel book, his life becomes more complicated, and the depth of his relationship with Sarah, relative to the shared loss they have faced, becomes an issue which must be revisited if he is ever to engage with life and explore the possibilities of a new life which Muriel offers. Filled with wonderful descriptions of life, both within Macon's family and in Europe, where he travels for research, the novel provides the reader with a full, realistic picture of marriage between people whose relationship has been, in part, the result of their commitment to their son. Poignant and emotional, but avoiding melodrama, the novel explores the meaning of life and love, the extent to which a marriage may limit or stimulate the growth of the people involved, and the ways in which a marriage must adapt to the new needs of the participants if it is to endure through time. n Mary Whipple
3	4	The late Dr. F.F. Bruce was a well respected biblical scholar and his commentaries and books have greatly benefited the Church of Christ. It is no different than with this work on the Book of Acts. This book falls in line with the rest of the New International Commentary on the New Testament edited by Gordon Fee. The NIC is a solid evangelical commentary on the New Testament with the differing opinions stated in the works (see Revelation for example). Dr. Bruce has gone to great lengths to point out the differences among evangelicals in Acts. The commentary itself is full of Greek word studies, historical and geographical points, maps, and solid exegesis of every passage in Acts. My only drawback with this work on Acts as well as the other works of the NICNT is that they are not laid out in expository outlines. It would be helpful if every section was given an expository outline to help the reader when moving through the sections of the Scriptures that the authors are working through. For a better expository outline see the commentaries of John MacArthur or John Phillips
3	4	In an inventive, imaginative plot, John Dunning successfully combines elements from 20th century literary and film history into a tale of deceit and psychological manipulation. Each of the players in this intricate plot of murder is lying - but about who, about what? Cliff Janeway tackles the conundrum in his usual style - intelligent, canny, suspicious, and sometimes over-emotional - and nearly comes to grief himself. What makes him such an appealing kind of guy is his need to act on his principles, regardless of risk. An intriguing backstory, twisty subplot, and surprise ending make Sign of the Book another page-turner
4	4	What can I say? Nora Roberts did it again in Angels Fall. I whipped through this book in record time again, then passed it on to a buddy (who also loved it). Her books just get better and better as she goes along
4	4	this book is short and brief (100 pages or so), that is its intended appeal. it is not and does not claim to be a comprehensive analysis of all theological and philosophical thought-- just a very thoughtful and broad view of the impact of thought, art, industry, etcetera and its culmination on the state of our current society. to this end the book is fullfilling
3	4	When I first started reading this book, the story seemed so outlandish that it all seemed too silly. Soon, though, I realized that it was a satirical look at a serious subject (censorship) and that the humor was actually a very effective way of getting the point across. The story is told in letters, predominantly between 19-yo cousins Tassie and Ella but occasionally in letters from or to their parents, neighbors and the Nazi-like town council that begins prohibiting the use of letters of the alphabet as they fall from their hero's statue (Nollop, inventor of the sentence "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."--of note because it contains every letter of the English alphabet). The idea that a government, especially one in a society as literate and as committed to honoring the English language as this one, would strangle its citizens with such laws is ludicrous; it is not only interesting but amusing to see how the community deals with the laws and their effects. First, like sheep being led to slaughter and, later, taking charge of their own destinies. I found Ella Minnow Pea a very quick and enjoyable read. It is light and funny but yet gives you something to think about. If you are a fan of language, you will likely enjoy it. It is rare that I come across a book that has a word in it with which I am not familiar; this book contained MANY words unfamiliar to me--a truly impressive level of vocabulary (though some words were, I think, coined by the islanders as a way of dealing with the prohibited letters). I recommend this book--especially for those who, like I, are concerned about the direction OUR society is taking in terms of censorship
1	1	Daniel B. Clendenin's EASTERN ORTHODOXY CHRISTIAN: A Western Perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of Christianity to Protestants. An evangelical Protestant, Clendenin became acquainted with Eastern Orthodoxy while teaching at Moscow State University. He is convinced that Protestants and Orthodox have much to learn from each other, and that Protestants should approach the East with a "hermeneutic of love". The work is divided into seven sections. The first is a general introduction and the second a brief history. The next four sections each deal with an aspect of Orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to Protestants. These are the emphasis on apophatic revelation, the use of icons, the relationship of Scripture and Tradition, and theosis. In the final section Clendenin critiques Orthodoxy from his Protestant perspective--dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in Orthodox churches--but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities. Clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics, however. I was not too impressed by the book. Much of the work is repetitive, and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed. Clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the Church. He writes, for example, that the Slavs were converted in 988, when this marked only the conversion of Kyiv Rus and most Slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier. His focus is entirely on the church in Russia and Greece/Byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored. The work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes, suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand. For Westerners curious about Orthodoxy, I think there is no better introduction than Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition. Clendenin's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between Protestants and Orthodox, but his work is really too short
3	4	A vitamin every six minutes ranks up there with Voltaire's 50 cups of coffee a day. Such monomania would seem frivolous were the stakes not so high. Ray is simply a Baby Boomer limping along better than most, until he catches the singularity train of (relative) immortality, which should be along real soon now. Except for the occasional howler--alkaline water comes to mind--the book offers sensible advice, though he should have included a chapter on how to raise the money to pay for all the tests, vitamins, supplements, and psychiatrists
1	4	The puzzles are great and a lot of fun for my two-year old. She loves anything 'princessy' so the princesses were a big selling point. However, after she did each puzzle a couple of times, the pieces didn't stay in the book. When we'd flip the page, all the pieces from that page would fall out. We ended up taking all the pieces out and putting them in a container, which is not the point of the book at all! At least the backs of the pieces are colored specifically for one puzzle in the book, and my daughter gets practice at sorting her colors for half an hour before we can play with her puzzles.
0	4	There is no doubt that Sun Tzu's little book on war is an enduring classic, but this little edition is ridiculous. There is a reason it is so cheap. It is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction. If you are going to take the trouble to buy and read Sun Tzu's masterpiece, you should at least get a version that explains what Sun Tzu was really talking about. The best translation is by Giles, as is this, but in the original Giles translation there is a running commentary, between the lines by Giles and several classical Chinese scholars, explaining both the context and meaning of the text. It is virtually impossible to really appreciate what Sun Tzu was talking about without the background that the original Giles translation provides. There are several editions of the full Giles edition available. Any of them are a better choice than this little stripped down version. The best is the Special Edition that contains two copies of the translation - one stripped down version, like this edition, in addition to the Chinese text and the fully annotated version that is twice as long as the unexplained translation. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for
1	1	This book was very shallow and too general. Didn't go in depth at all.
0	1	I am certainly agreed with &quot; a reader from San Francisco&quot;. I have almost all of Lilian Too's Feng Shui Books and a recently bought her EoFS. I have found her recent publications are nothing, but just a repetition of her previous books. Certainly a great disappointment from a master! Please Lilian don't published just for the sake of publishing
0	1	Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now. Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book. More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult. The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere. The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing. I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time. I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.
0	1	Possibly the worst book I have ever read. The "style" could be bested by a not-too-bright fifth grader. The plot is an imbecilic rehash of the Divinci Code. Don't bother keeping track of any details, because everything turns out to be irrelevant. If you want to entertain yourself and your friends, however, check this out of your local library and get mildly drunk. Now open the book at random and read aloud. This should cause hysterical I-can't-believe-this-got-published laughter.
4	4	I originially bought this book because I am a fan of McSorley's and wanted to learn a little about New York History. I had no previous knowledge of Joseph Mitchell's works, and did not know what to expect. I wondered how someone could write a 350 page book about when bar. Then i soon realized that the book is a compilation of short stories about the characters of the city in the 30's and 40's. Primary source history usually bores me, because it is often dry, about someone consequential, and you have to read through alot for a little interesting information. But the way Mitchell presents these characters you are drawn in into their plight,eccentricities, or just regular routines. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the city, or if you are a fan of the bar and are just curious like mysel
4	4	This book was such a relief because it covered classroom discipline, from the beginning, without talking down to the reader. The chapters are organized so that you can implement the methods right away, in a useful sequence without becoming overwhelmed. You need to read this book if you fear you are a pushover in the classroom. I have used these methods in a multicultural classroom with more than half of my students as non-native English speakers. It really works! There is a tremendous feeling of respect between everyone in the classroom. I was especially pleased with the effect on one of my students who was severely abused as a child and who grew up very untrusting in foster homes, etc. In September, he was violent with himself and with other children, striking classroom objects or people when he was angry. Other teachers are amazed at how much he has changed since the beginning of the school year. I owe so much to the advice in this book
0	1	I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting. I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good
0	1	WOULD SOMEONE WHO HAS READ THIS BOOK PLEASE WRITE A REVIEW MORE THAN 7 WORDS LONG SO THOSE OF US WHO HAVEN'T READ IT WILL HAVE AN IDEA WHAT IT IS ABOUT
0	1	I would refer anyone who would take this author seriously to James Randi's comments on his behavior. He represents the modern version of the crystal ball reader and his claims should be eyed with an appropriate degree of skepticism. This would be a benign phenomenon but that his success depends on the suspension of reasoned thought on the part of those who grieve for their lost loved ones
4	4	STan really did keep and care for James and his family, including when JAmes briefly returned to Ireland to establish an art cinema chain leaving his family in ITaly. Excellent insight into the brilliant writer by his also brilliant brother. Please read this book for greater understanding and afection for the specifics of Joyce's work (how stan was pictured in the story A Painful Case), although the view of the universal themes grows dim as we can no longer see the woods for the trees Essential to any complete James JOyce bookshelf and a wonderful and grateful gift for any member of the fervent Joycean faith
0	1	Boring and irritating. Not one character is likable, and not one character is 3D
0	4	Nothing new in this book and CD does not add to the value of this purchase. I purchased the book and CD combination in hopes of having experiential exercises. Exercises are provided, yet the author merely explains these on the CD versus guiding one through a meditation. It feels as if he is merely reading the directions for the exercises and the exercises are not new or imaginative. If one is new to self help books on healing trauma or anxiety, this may be the book for you. I've read and heard authors and psychologists talk about the flight and fight response over 20 years ago. I, personally, have found more healing/success in spiritual books, guided meditations or intense physical exercise where my heart rate increases or in strength training.
0	1	What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel. The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog. When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about. It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy. I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book. This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement. She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing." Obviously not a person who knows me well. Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing. I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless
0	1	I'm glad that I got this book out from the library instead of buying it. It provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup, and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they're straight from the 80's. I really don't know anyone who wears scarves, overalls, or blouses to school. The language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated. I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and "beauty diversity", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls. The author herself was a Miss Teen Claifornia finalist, so I suppose one couln't expect much more. I would avoid buying this for a young girl, or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl
4	4	Witnesses to Freedom focuses on the efforts and dedication of young African-Americans during the Civil Rights Movement. The stories of protesters as young as nine years old are narrated as well as told through the eyes of the young freedom fighters. This book highlights not only the more famous young activists that students may not have exposure to, but many young people who did both big and small things to help make the movement. For example, the book opens with a story about Barbara Johns, a teenager who led a movement in her school to boycott for better educational facilities and resources. The book also tells the stories of more famous teenagers like Elizabeth Eckford who integrated Little Rock's all white Central High, and Claudette Colvin who was arrested for not giving up her seat to a white person on a Montgomery bus months before Rosa Park's famous arrest. While the book highlights specific individuals, the stories place a strong emphasis on the importance of group participation for social change. Each young activist was working to inspire others to join the cause, and make the movement truly powerful. Photographs are also included of the young activists which adds a personal touch to their stories of struggle and survival. This book would be an excellent book to introduce students to the struggle and inspire them to want to learn more about the history of African-Americans. The emphasis on the power of young people to make social change makes this book an excellent resource for children. This book would be best suited for older children ages 11 and 12. The book is written in a more mature format, and covers more mature subject matter
4	4	This great little book is full of easy juicing recipes. Another good thing about this book is that Jay goes into detail about the vast, enormous benefits of a raw foods vegan diet. I am not a raw foodist, but as a vegan it is wonderful that Jay informs people who buy this book who may not be Vegan the simple fact that one can easily get calcium from other sources than cows milk. I have had a juicer for two years and still refer back to this book from time to time
0	1	Wow...This book was boring and confusing. I got it for my international finance class and it is just really hard to follow. It was a waste of money
4	4	K.M. Soehnlein did not strike a single false note for me in his coming-of-age novel. The non-linear nature of many conversations (which still communicate much to both the listeners AND the speakers), the guilt and excitement that a person feels when he continues to experience life during tragic circumstances, the way a series of bold decisions suddenly add up to a life spinning wildly out of control: all of these ring true to me. The protagonist Robin McKenzie is destined for greater things than his suburban New Jersey town can give him -- he's smart, creative, and hungry -- but we're lucky to have a peak into the half-year when his life and identity are transformed (unfortunately, by an accident when childhood teasing gets out-of-hand). The book is written for adults, although older teenagers might be ready for it. I imagine that some high school gays will dog-ear certain hot sections for re-reading. I would have done so had I stumbled on such a book when I was in high school. Wait, I did ... **SPOILER** And for once in recent fiction, a gay relationship in high school is shown to be the intoxicating, confusing, educational and FINITE experience that it often is. I look forward to reading more from K.M. Soehnlein
4	4	This book by Reader's Digest is wonderful. I know some basic needlepoint and embroidery, but this book also has instructions for knitting and crocheting, of which I know little about. Also has section on rug-making! Very comprehensive and easy to follow
4	3	In spite of the complicated Linux kernel architecture, this book can deliver a first glance but detailed information on each core part inside Linux kernel. Readers can easily understand it's concepts after reading even without previous kernel development experience
1	4	I have long been hoping to find the ONE career book that will point me in the write direction of finding the career that I want out of life. I'm coming to believe that these books are mostly a waste of money. This book contains a personality test that is not unlike any other career assessment test that you can take online, for FREE. It then contains a boat load of charts...50 highest paying jobs for this personality type....50 jobs for this personality type with the highest amount of women/men employed...ect ect. If this sort of thing interests you then by all means this book might be for you. Most of the book however is a list of different jobs for the different personality types that contains descriptions, experience/education needed, related job, ect but it is all on a VERY BASIC level. Save your money and speak with a career counsler
4	4	Agatha Christie's Death In The Clouds comes to life under Hugh Fraser's experienced voice: his past experiences bring other Hercule Poirot mysteries in the series to life lends a uniformity of experience and sound to this latest. The sudden death of a female passenger on an intercontinental plane flight involves investigator Hercule Poirot in a search for the culprit - even when the investigation seems to point to Poirot as the possible perp. Fine tension and mystery evolve slowly and grippingly
0	1	I read dragon's milk first and enjoyed that alot. this book proved to be a big disappointment. the story at first was so boring and lyf found herself in horrible situations. like there was no way to get out. i couldn't even finish this book! It was THAT boring!!!!!!! i want to get the first book in this series and see whether it's bette
1	1	While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them. Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates. If you're looking for this type of book, I strongly recommend &quot;Women on Top&quot;
1	4	If you are familiar with modular knitting, this book offers nothing new. The patterns didn't appeal to me at all; there was no snap to the designs. If you aren't familiar with modular knitting, there are better books from which to learn
1	1	It's taken me a while to get through this book partly because I'm not very excited about the plot and partly because the author's self-conscious writing style really annoys me. There are lovely phrases here and there, but there are plenty of others that read like something you'd find in a greeting card--they try hard to impress and fail. The author makes deliberate, almost constant use of foreshadowing, perhaps in an attempt to get the reader to stick with the book and not lay it down for good. I'm contemplating the latter
1	4	Robert Allen is one of the many real estate "gurus" in the world who probably makes more money selling you the "secrets" to real estate then actually practicing his own advice. I have noticed that people either hate his stuff or love it. I am guessing those who love his stuff haven't actually tried to do it. The book has a lot of wealth building ideas, but many of them are dangerous to the beginning investor and really require a lot of experience and knowledge to pull off successfully, which is not the typical reader of his books. He is looking for the person who needs to find the "magic bullet" for easy wealth and success, but unfortunately you won't find any magic bullets or fantastic money making secrets in this book. What you will find is a bunch of average ideas that are painted with a very deceptive picture of how much work, money, and experience you actually need to be successful. He spends a lot of time discussing real estate investing, which is where he got his start, but a beginning investor should understand that what he teaches is hard, takes a lot of time, and requires experience. You will probably need some of your own money and will need to have good skills in sales, marketing, construction, and general business. Some of the actual investing ideas are ok, but not easily and it certainly not without a lot of work, which will exclude a lof of people. He also offers advice on investing in rare coins and while I know individuals who do this and some actually make a lot of money doing it most people should understand that doing this requires a lot of experience and knowledge and it not an investment that should be undertaken without a lot of information. Overall his ideas are average, but they require a lot of work and information and in many cases your own money to truly make them work. If you can take any of ONE of his ideas and make a lot of money doing it you will definately earn it through the amount of hard work, knowledge learned, and experience you must earn. It will not be as easy as Mr. Allen makes it out to be and will definately take more time then he suggests. If you already do some of the types of investing he discusses and you know what you are getting into then you could read the book for a few average ideas but you won't get much more from it.
0	1	ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.
1	3	Here's the scoop: The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added. That's only part of the problem. David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice. If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort. Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part. Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention. However, her parts are very small. I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem
4	4	I borrowed a copy of its second edition a few days ago and have just finish it. I just love this book. I wish that I would have a chance to read this book a few years ago.
0	1	I bought this book thinking that it might be more than the usual time line history that so many other writers have produced. I was bitterly disappointed. Nothing new to add to the history of the band and really quite a bland read. As someone who knows that there was more to the 'lads' than what has been previously written, I was expecting more insight into their lives, more accurate information, and basically just MORE. The title of the book is quite misleading, as the only Babylon that seemed to go on was Tam's alledged chasing of Pat around hotel rooms and one recalled incident of Les and a mate hiding 2 groupies on a freezing balcony. If you know anything about the Rollers, you don't need to buy this book in hopes of learning more. It simply isn't there. A huge disappointment for this long time Roller fan.
4	4	Some books are optional. "The Worm Ouroboros", by E. R. Eddison, is not. It is more than just the birth of high fantasy writing as we know it. It is a tale that connects with imagination and wonder in a way that books today simply don't do. When you read "The Worm Ouroboros" you'll realize that modern writers produce stories, but they don't tell Stories. Since the English language fails to provide me with adequate superlatives for this review, I'll just have to present samples of Eddison's writing: "But a great wonder of this chamber, and a marvel to behold, was how the capital of every one of the four-and-twenty pillars was hewn from a single precious stone, carved by the hand of some sculptor of long ago into the living form of a monster: here was a harpy with a screaming mouth, so wonderously cut in ochre-tinted jade it was a marvel to hear no scream from her: here in wine-yellow topaz a flying fire-drake: there a cockatrice made of a single ruby: there a star sapphire the colour of moonlight, cut for a cyclops, so that the rays of the star trembled from his single eye: leviathans, all hewn from faultless gems, thrice the bulk of a big man's body, velvet-dark sapphires, crystolite, beryl, amethyst, and the yellow zircon that is like transparent gold." (7) Everyone can write description, but only Eddison could write description like this. He makes the colors shine brighter and the shapes of the "monsters" stick out in your mind. And even though you may not know what a crystolite looks like, you agree that it fits perfectly into this paragraph. Eddison realized that you can't a world that mirrors the heroic past if you get stuck in the decidedly un-heroic language of modern times. "Now had they for three days or four a devious journey through the foot-hills, and thereafter made their dwelling for forty days' space in the Zia valley, above the gorges. Here the valley widens to a flat-floored amphitheatre, and lean limestone crags tower heavenward on every side. High in the south , couched above great gray moraines, the Zia glacier, wrinkle-backed like some dragon survived out of the elder chaos, thrusts his snout into the valley. Here out of his caves of ice the young river thunders, casting up a spray where rainbows hover in bright weather. The air blows sharp from the glacier, and alpine flowers and shrubs feed on the sunlight." (153) Perhaps it's because I'm a mountain-climber myself, but I found Juss and Brandoch Daha's assault on Koshtra Pivrarcha to be the most memorable chapter in a book built out of unforgettable chapters. In real life no two mountain ranges are alike, yet most fantasy authors write only staid standard-issue descriptions when they make mountains. Eddison understood that for us to see the glaciers, feel the biting cold winds, and experience the exhilaration of reaching the summit with the heroes, he needs to give his mountains some real personality. These samples, of course, only scratch the surface of Eddison's brilliant mix of visceral detail and towering metaphor; he maintains this level, never flagging, for all two hundred thousand words. But of course "The Worm Ouroboros" could hardly have claimed such a lofty space in the pantheon of imaginative fiction without a plot and character worthy of this lavish writing. On one side King Gorice XII of Witchland sends his warriors out to crush all opposition and subjugate the entire world to his will. Opposing him are the adventure-loving lords of Demonland, lead by the magnificent Lord Juss and his family. The ensuing conflict will rage on land and sea, across continents and mountain ranges. And without any doubt Eddison crafts his dialogue with the same mastery he displays in his narration: "La Fireez," said Juss, "we weigh not so lightly our obligation unto thee. Yet must I hold my course; having sworn a strong oath that I would turn aside neither to the right nor to the left until I had delivered my dear brother goldry out of bondage. So sware I or ever went that ill journey to Carce and was closed in prison fast and by thee delivered. Nor shall blame of friends nor wrongful misprison nor any power that is shake me in this determination. But when that is done, no rest remaineth unto us till we win back for thee thy rightful realm of Pixyland, and many good things besides to be a token of our love." Said the Prince, "Thou doest right. If thou didst other thou'dst have my blame." "And mine thereto," said Gaslark. "Do not I grieve, think'st thou, to see the Princess Armelline, my sweet young cousin, grow every day more wan o' the cheek and pale? And all for sorrow and teen for her own true love, the Lord Goldry Bluszco. And she so carefully brought up by her mother as nothing was too dear or hard to be bought to pass for her desire, thinking that a creature so noble and perfect could not be trained up too delicately. I deem to-day better than to-morrow, and to-morrow better than his morrow, to set sail for wide-fronted Impland." (315) One of the most commonly used review terms is larger than life. "The Worm Ouroboros" is larger than larger than life. Indeed, after finishing you may wonder whether it would be more appropriate to refer to real life as "smaller than Eddison"
1	1	I certainly agree that Portis is a talented writer, but I just didn't find him all that funny. Perhaps I'm missing something, but I thought that the characters were strange enough, not amusing, just strange. I was frustrated by the characters and the world that they inhabited. I forced myself to finish the book and I was rewarded by the one funny line in the whole book, which comes at the very end of the novel
0	1	This seems to be a converted thesis to book, not the worst job but certainly without much effort. I'm not surprised its not in stock.
4	4	I give this memoir five stars for the the author's curiousity, acumen and intelligence, all of which inform this wide-ranging tale. Eating My Words will answer your questions about Mimi Sheraton's adventures as a New York Times food critic, travel writer and magazine editor, as well as stints spent as consultant to venues ranging from the famed Four Seasons restaurant to public schools and hospital kitchens. Through it all, Sheraton reveals a keen intellect, a dedication to research, and a passion for accuracy. Her prose is direct rather than lyrical, but the reader will emerge with a better understanding of restaurants and both admiration and appreciation for a woman and writer who has lived her life well. Especially worthy savoring are Sheraton's love for her husband, Richard Falcone-- their marriage of 49 years gives a happy backdrop to this memoir, and Sheraton's reminiscences of her parents, who imbue her with wit, chutzpah, and lifelong curiousity about all things culinary. Also welcome are Sheraton's observations about the workplace: "It's not your job, the employer has rented it to you," she observes, noting that if the job no longer suits you, it is time to quit-- something that Sheraton did several times in her career, including her departure from the New York Times. My appreciation for Sheraton and this book grew as I progressed through the narrative. My initial four star appraisal had grown to five my the end of this memoir, chiefly because of my admiration for Sheraton and her well-lived life. This is a woman who has lived with zest and integrity aned, thankfully, has chosen to share her experiences with us. We should all be so lucky
1	4	I bought this book for myself, expecting to find some useful advice to help me organize my day a little better and to stay focused on priorities. I have been in management for 12 years and I expected this book to offer some new insights into time management and other daily challenges. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and struggled to find some useful advice within the first half and have since put it down. The book seems to target a junior audience with a certain type of personality that is more focused on fitting in and accommodating others, rather than those focused on leadership and results. The book itself feels really cheap. I is printed on that cheap news-print paper like those crossword puzzle books.
1	1	Mark Rank proposes many interesting ideas that attempt redefine how we think about poverty in America. Most of his ideas are solid, but my deepest concern is with the readers who gave this book 5 stars and used the word "interesting" to describe it. Did they actually read it? This book is an unending parade of boring and repeated ideas presented in different, yet equally boring ways. I honestly beleive that this book has destroyed the thrill of musical chairs for me forever. This book could have been written in about 150 pages instead of the 250 it actually took if he simply used his original, not to mention solid, ideas. The nature of the book greatly weakened his overall argument. Not only was the book dry, but it also seemed to fail to acknowledge the global system the US is a part of, and in particular, the role that immigration plays on poverty in the US. He talks about the US and the people in it as if they were static, but we live in a very fluid world, growing more fluid everyday, and I feel that his failure to ackowledge this fact truly hurts his overall argument.
3	4	Easy to read, understand, and put into practice. Common sense, practical advice. Similar content as his "Being Zen" book
4	4	This is an enjoyable book that gives one pause to think about the words one reads in novels. Written by an English Prof; it gives insight into the meaning of words; especially as the are used in books
4	4	I asked for this book because I thought it would give advice on how to raise daughters--it does--and more. Dr. Northrup begins by explaining how mothers and daughters are connected through the generations, and how we can only create a healthy relationship with our daughter when we heal our relationship with our mother. As we heal ourselves, we heal all the women who have gone on before us. This is only a sample of some of the insight she offers into our relationships as women. I'll admit I was surprised by the holistic approach she takes, but am glad she offers that insight, as I'm only vaguely familiar with some of the ideas/theories and believe I have more to grow in that area. Rather than a book geared towards raising children (I've read my share--and I thought that's what this book would be) I would categorize this book as a self-help book geared toward strengthening and creating a healthy relationship with your mother and daughter. Very pleased with everything I've read
1	1	Lewis' qualifications as mid-east scholar sound impressive but I was disappointed by this book. Although interesting, some of the essays are indicative of senility. The title says "interpreting" so I will allow him creative license. Expect to find the kind of stuff you would look for in Stalin's treatise on the U.S. Constitution
1	1	What exactly is positive about the Koran and its view of women? Every single assertion of this polemic is either a complete fabrication or wrong. The Hadiths and Sunna are not the chauvinistic part 'corrupting' the Koran, if anything the opposite is true. In Surah 4:34 the Koran orders the Husband to beat his wife. In numerous Suras the husband is ordered to pay the equivalent of a dowry to his wife, not her family however. The entire Koranic book of 'women' is simply one law after another about 'them' which is to say the women. The reason it is talking about 'them' when referring to women and 'us' when speaking about men is because the Koran is meant for men. There is not one equality in the entire Koran dealing with women and men. Men may take four wives women, women presumably one husband. Men may have slaves and men may marry and do as they please sexually with the slaves. No similar injunction applies for women. Men receive virgins and wine and service in heaven...the situation of women in heaven is left to the imagination, although presumably they make up the virgins. The Koran details a world of only men where women are not only chattel but are the sexual objects of the society, sold as slaves and used and then divorced at the mans pleasure. There is not one equality. Scholars have argued that Koran reformed women's rights and elevated their status because in pre-Islamic Arabia women had NO rights and under Koran they are entitled to at least a dowry and a man may not take endless numbers of wives. This doesn't translate as equality, it translates as a male centered world, where men are masters and women are virtually property. The fact that god in Koran is not referred to as 'father' does not indicate a feminist view of god but merely reflects the very monotheistic nature of Islam, certainly a valid fact that differentiates it from Christianity. However once again this is not evidence of women's rights, because the non-gender view of god doesn't change the very negative view of women's role on earth given in the Koran. If someone is going to read this they should certainly have handy an unbiased translation of the Koran so they can reflect on all the laws regarding women and why those same laws do not apply equally to men, for instance one might wonder why a wife may not beat her disobeying husband? Or why the husband is not commanded to be modest? Seth J. Frantzman
4	4	Great book, easy to read. Lots of information about different hair types and braiding tips. Step-by-step instruction on braiding techniques and braiding styles for all age groups and ethnic backgrounds. If you're into hair cosmetology this is a must have.
1	1	More fish recipes than your normal cook-in-advance books. I didn't want to buy the book, but my cat spilled iced tea on the borrowed copy (helpful kitty). There were a few interesting recipes, but everything was way too complicated and expensive. I have since given my copy to a thrift store. If you enjoy cooking and eating gourmet recipes, but don't have the time, this might be for you. If you can borrow it at the library (via interlibrary loan if your branch doesn't have it) you can better judge it. I can't recommend it, because I found almost nothing appealing. But tastes are personal, and YMMV. Just keep the book away from iced tea and cats
3	4	The best parts of The Lost Painting: The Quest for a Caravaggio Masterpiece, by Jonathan Harr, deal with the artist himself. When most artists are considered eccentric, Caravaggio was a renegade in his actions. A fighter. He killed a man, and lived his last years on the run. Many of his paintings were initially discounted, but his popularity grew in later years. I enjoyed the book, and found the idea of these lost masterpieces, valued in the tens of millions of dollars, to be out there somewhere very fascinating. Four stars & recommended.
4	4	Judith Butler's study of Antigone, over the course of these 3 lectures, yields important and timely insights about how we might understand kinship and love in today's society. Her analysis of Hegel, Levi-Strauss, and Lacan is impressively rigorous. A must read for anyone interested in liguistics, structuralism, feminism and contemporary questions about political belonging.
4	3	i bought the book after reading a shorter tolstoy story, years ago. at first i was intimidated by the length of this story and couldnt get into it to start. finally, i picked it up again and was dissapointed i waited so long, it definitely doesnt seem as long once you get going. its an amazing book and has become one of my favorite
4	4	Even a few years after it's release, Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation" still sends a strong message to the reader and exposes the fast food industry for what it really is... a group of very large and very powerful marketing companies... not a purveyor of good food--or nutritious food for that matter. For many years, food additives and techniques have been the dirty little secret of the industry, but not these things are starting to surface. The book takes you through the processing warehouses and chemical plants that the industry uses to "make" the foods served at these restaurants. It opens your eyes to practices done to cut costs and sacrifice your health in the process. I've recommended this book to many of my clients and many are reluctant to read it at all, probably because of the emotional attachment they have to their favorite fast food. Since this book came out, there are so many more studies and reports on what is in the fast foods then there ever were before. Reports including additives, trans-fats and other inflammation causing ingredients are helping the industry clean up it's act. This doesn't mean that fast food is good for you, it just means that Schlosser has done an excellent job at bringing attention to an industry that wasn't challenged as strongly as it should have been. I personally haven't had fast food for over 5 years, but--even that far removed--as I was reading this I felt sick to my stomach. Read this book and you'll never step foot in McDonalds again.

1	1	This is simply a rehash of Dr. Burns previous writings. If you have read Feeling Good, it is a waste of money to purchase this book. He covers the same material but change the names the scenerios. He is a one trick pony and clearly has done no more recent research , since the prior books
1	1	The other reviewers will tell you about the book. I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read. What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism. I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published. I guess most people will sell their souls for money. Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments). The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men. The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters. This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women. So this is just a warning. If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.
4	4	I read this one for the first time in 1959, a year after it was published. This story has never left me. For some reasone it left quite an impression. Recently I ran across a copy at a book sale and purchased it, took it home and read it again. I now know why it has stayed with me all these year! It is good! I have, over the years read quite a number of Heinlein's works and I must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch. I realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader, but, as I just found out, it is quite a nice read for the older reader also. As I remember, looking back, this book rather inspired me in many ways, and doing better in school was by no means the least. Some of Heinlein's later work was rather difficult for me to digest, i.e. I simply did not like them. I rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one. Recommend this one highly.
1	4	The book starts on the premise that competitive strategy is a complex subject and that Michael porter did give us a good structure/framework to analyze this phenomenon to succeed in the market place. Then the author is quick to add that among all forces analyzed by porter, "barriers to entry" is the most significant factor that affects competitive strategy. This is how the author sets the stage to explain "Competition Demystified" With this quick and firm conclusion on the most significant factor affecting competitive strategy, the book starts off with case after case to justify this hypothesis. To simplify things, it looks at sustained profit margins and continuity of the key players in the given space as a proof for entry barriers. This approach is perhaps to support the second part of the title of the book "A Radically Simplified Approach to Business Strategy ". Granted that the cases discussed do justify the assumptions and are supported by hard facts or published numbers. But if competition lends itself to just a couple of variables, then every company can follow the strategy and hence no competition at all!. In fact one can say "The end of competition". Kindly recall "The end of history..." The book however deserves praise for use of Game Theory in a simple non mathematical approach to analyze competitive situations and the behavior of the players. But again, this approach is just a part of the problem and not a full explanation of competitive strategy. Given the speed of globalization and technological changes especially the internet in the last decade, the book fails to incorporate such forces that significantly affect the success of global firms. Too voluminous, and fails to impress on what it sets out to accomplish.
1	1	I have read all of Patricia Cornwell books and love them all. Except this one. I just liked it. It was okay. Not what I've come to expect from one of my favorite authors. I was excited to see that there were new characters and I did enjoy them - as much as there was to know about them. However the whole story did not develop very well, and it left me feeling like I missed a whole bunch of the 'potential' story. I ended the book feeling like Ms. Cornwell was trying to make a statement to someone with this book rather than telling a story. Very disappointed.
0	1	I think the book is very flippant and uninformative. If you are looking for hard facts, skip this one. I'd like to return it for a refund and I'd be embarrased to pass it on
4	4	Sheldon Stern has presented a harrowing study of one of the most dangerous events in World History - The Cuban Missile Crisis. In his book, The Week the World Stood Still: Inside the Secret Cuban Missile Crisis, we are presented with an event whose story line reads like it was written by a Robert Ludlum-like mystery writer, this story, however, was frighteningly true history. With the careful, thoughtful, and thorough research that is Mr. Stern's trademark, the reader is presented with the complete inside story of that fateful week. This is a must read for, not only students, but adults as well. Kudos
0	1	Although this electronic atlas has all the Netter plates, and quite a few nice new ones, as well as some radiographic views, it is nearly unusable in practice. The images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible. The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation). Part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar, so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640. If you estimate a typical plate to be 10&quot; x 10&quot;, that works out to maybe 50 dpi. Many of the smaller features on the original art cannot be seen on tne electronic version, and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going. The quality does not change when you print or zoom in. All the other bells and whistles, like the study lists, searching, etc. just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful. And the user interface is terribly archaic, nonstandard, and hard to use. The font for the lables is horrible. Also, I'm not sure I like the pronunciation of the speaking feature: &quot;pec-tor-AY-lis major&quot;? If you have the cash to spare, it makes a nice toy, but it is not worth the price
3	4	Janette Oke in this book is wonderful. She places infront of me the examples I need to know. All of us need to know. most people in this world today would not be such wonderful examples. I do not know of many myself. Showing me the way to see the positive in the negative, I find that this is a very special book, indeed
